        in `Save.injury_types`, and `type_name` is empty for those: fmsave ships no injury
        names of its own.

        A row whose person the save no longer keeps as a player leaves `player_uid` and
        `player_name` empty, which is about one `HISTORY` row in twenty. A `HISTORY` row whose
        team no club lists, or which names no team at all, leaves `team_id` and the three club
        fields empty rather than guessing; that is about one row in five hundred. Two views
        this table has no field for::

            history = career_save.injuries()
            own = history.where(player_uid=player_uid)
            typed_date = next(row.date for row in own if row.kind == "typed")
            # The latest history row on or before a typed row's date, for the same player.
            before = [
                row.date

            ]
            days_between = (typed_date - max(before)).days if before else None

        `days_between` is the gap between two dates and never how long the player was out for,
        which no row of this table holds. Filtering by a player's club today is
        `where(player_uid=...)` against `Save.players`, since `club_uid` here is the club at

        **Only some clubs have a series at all.** The save keeps one for the clubs of the one or
        two league nations it tracks, not for every club it holds, and which nations those are
        changes as a career moves on, so a club with no rows here is ordinary rather than a
        failure. On the saves measured 57 to 335 clubs of the 48,000 to 51,000 each save holds
        had one, of between 3 and 60 months each; 60 months is as many as a club keeps. A save
        whose clubs keep none at all returns an empty table, and on a save with no human manager
        that is also what a search finding nothing would return: the checks bound the rows that
        were decoded, and the one count they bound from below applies only where the save lists
        a managed club. `fmsave validate` reports the clubs with a series and the club records
        searched either way.

        `balance` is the balance at the **end** of the row's month, and `net_transfers` is
        positive for a net **spend**. **Money is a whole number in the save's base currency,

        balance, both budgets, the wage bill and the month's income and expenditure all display
        at about 1.157 times the stored value, one rate fitting every one of them, which is
        what says the stored unit is its own unit. Nothing here is converted and no rate is
        applied. The weekly fields are weekly; every other money field is one month's amount.
        `transfer_budget_allocated` is **not** the budget the board allocated: that screen
        showed a budget well above it with almost none of it spent, so what the field is stays
        unnamed.

        `month` is worked out from the save's own date rather than stored: the last row of a
        club is the month before the save's month, which is the lag that put that club's two
        oldest rows on the months its own screen labelled them with. Several useful figures are
        arithmetic on these rows rather than fields: wage headroom is `wage_budget_weekly` less
        `wage_payroll_weekly`, a yearly figure is a weekly one times 52, a club's latest month
        is its last row, and a club summary is its rows grouped by `club_uid`.

        A row is one person at one club: the department lists the club keeps him in, what his
        contract pays and until when, his ability and the preferences a staff profile shows.
        **A person an affiliate side lists whose contract is with that side's parent is one row
        at the parent**, with the side that lists him in `listed_club_uid`, the same rule a
        player on a B team follows. A person a club lists but pays nothing has no contract to
        read, so his `wage` and both dates are empty rather than zero; about one listed person
        in seven of a save is like that.

        **The save's human manager is a row of his own**, with `is_human_manager` true. His
        object is laid out differently, so no ability, no preferences and none of the
        ability-block `unknown` keys read for him, while his name, birth date, personality and
        contract read as anyone's do.

        **The contract codes are not player squad statuses.** `unknown["contract_e36"]` comes
        from the byte a player's squad status is read from, but it takes different values on
        staff and no displayed label has named one, so it and the three codes beside it ship as
        raw numbers.

        **The job title is not readable, and `unknown["r4"]` is not it.** A club's staff screen
        settled that: over 78 displayed rows, 8 of the 16 codes on show carried two or more
        different job titles and 7 titles appeared under two or three different codes, so the
        byte keeps its raw number rather than becoming a named role. **The club's board is not
        in this table either**: the president, the director and the managing director appear on
        that same screen with no row here, while every other person on it matched a row.

        Several useful figures are arithmetic on these rows rather than fields: a club's
        non-playing wage bill is the sum of `wage` over its rows, how many of its staff it
        lists is `where(in_club_lists=True)`, and who it pays without listing is

        One row per team, in the order the save stores them: the first team, the reserves, the
        youth side and each team the club fields at a club it controls, which maps back to the
        managed club with the slot it holds in that club's list. **No other club has a
        calendar at all**, and a save whose manager runs no club returns an empty table.

        **Which week runs which schedule is settled.** Each weekly record holds the week's
        start date and then a schedule name, and the name is the schedule of the week whose
        date came before it: a manager's Training screen showed exactly that schedule for four
        consecutive weeks, where pairing each name with the following week would have been a
        week out on all four. The dates themselves are solid too: consecutive weeks step
        exactly seven days on every pair of every calendar measured, and the calendar runs from
        well before the save's date to well after it.

        The active week of a team is the latest one that has started. A week whose stored date
        does not decode carries None, and a save whose date is unreadable has nothing to
        compare against, so both are stepped around::

                if week.week_start is not None and clock is not None and week.week_start <= clock
            ]
            active = max(started, default=None, key=lambda week: week.week_start)

        What a schedule asks of a day is **not** read: each day of a week holds three codes
        whose meaning is unknown. `schedule_library` is the manager's own saved schedules,
        which the save keeps once per section rather than per team, so every row carries the
        same tuple, and the save may hold the same schedule twice over under two ids.

        The table is read on the first call to `training()` or `mentoring()`, from one walk;
        later calls to either return the same tables. When a check of that walk fails, neither
        table is kept, so both raise.

        Raises:
            SaveClosedError: The save is closed.
            SaveChangedError: The file changed on disk after it was opened.
            CorruptSaveError: The save is damaged or was being written.
