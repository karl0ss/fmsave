# FM26 history sections: reverse-engineering notes

Working notes for decoding the ~55 section types fmsave 0.5.8 does not yet read.
Ground truth: a real career save (`Karl Hudgell - UnemployedNew.fm`, build 26.3.2+2329565)
that started as an FM24 save imported into FM26, in-game date 2037-12-04, one club
(St. Albans City, save club uid 716, database unique_id 717).

## Section header grammar

Every history section opens with `03 01 <4-char type tag>` (`tmc.` or `tad.` at least
so far), then tag/version-specific header words. fmsave does not parse these tags
(`_container.py` only opens the container itself, magic `02 01 'fmf.'`); the history
readers we write own this grammar.

## Decoded so far

### comp_history_dt — LAYOUT CRACKED (55-byte uniform rows)

File = `tmc.` header (52 B) + rows + tail. On the ground-truth save: 82,800 rows.

**Header (52 B):**
```
03 01 'tmc.' 03 00        (8 B)
u32 0
u32 0x768  = 1896         (earliest season in the table?)
u32 0xd6   = 214
u32 0xde   = 222
u32 0x1ab0d = 109,069
ff * 24                   (24 sentinel bytes, 6 x u32 -1)
```

**Rows:** stride is 55 B, but block start offsets VARY between regions of the file —
the section is a stream of variable-length groups, and within a group every row is
uniformly 55 B (one group showed 82,351 consecutive 55-gap record starts). A row:

```
[u16 y_a] [u16 y_b] [u16 small] [u16 y4]         8 B
[u32] * 11 slots                                44 B
[3-byte marker] [n] [type] [00]                  3 B   = LEAD of the NEXT record
```

Two record shapes, distinguished by the type byte in the 3-byte marker:

- **type 04** — league season rows (slot0+ = competition id / club list):
  e.g. season 1993/94: `12 | 1995 | 736 715 716 | ff...` (comp id 12, then clubs).
  The `xx 04 00` marker precedes each league row; 50,339 rows end in `00 04 00`.
- **type 02** — club/chain rows (club uid in slot 0):
  e.g. `716 | 2020 | 3486 | 263` (club 716, prev-year 2020, two reference ids).
  The u32s in slots 2-3 chain seasons (9498 and 4312 recur across rows as
  prev/next links); 22,317 type-02 candidate records found.

**St. Albans club-league block** (contiguous, offset 0x1340f2, ~30 rows, type 02):
covers seasons 1991 → 2021/22 and then stops — exactly matching the ground truth
that after the FM24→FM26 import the manager-history screens say "data only valid
from 26/12/2024". So comp_history_dt holds the pre-import (originally FM24) season
chain, and post-import seasons must live in other sections — the search target for
the 2023/24 onward league rows.

The u16 y_a/y_b pairs in the block: single-season rows show y_a==y_b (e.g.
2021/2021), multi-year spans show (1975,1976), (1977,1978), (1993,1994),
(1995,1996), (2018,2019) — so the pair is a spell start/end, not per-season rows.

### tc_manager_history_dt / _ls — CRACKED: one row per ended spell, one list per team, INTEGRATED (`Save.manager_spells()`; checkpoint 2026-10-11, scratch `fm26-career/tmp_manager_history/m1–m29, v1–v2`)

**Integrated:** `ManagerHistorySpell`, `readers/manager_history.py`
(`decode_manager_history_lists`, `decode_manager_history`,
`resolve_manager_history_teams`, `current_job_spells`, `manager_spells`),
`Save.manager_spells(staff_uid=None)` (cached; 0.6 s after
`career_manager_records`), `docs/reference/manager_history.md`,
`tests/test_manager_history.py`.

**Layout (replaces the model below, which was wrong on every point):**
- dt = `03 01 'tmc.' 02 00` (8 B) + exactly 25,798 × 31-byte rows (799,746 = 8 +
  31·25,798). The "header count 7,984" is the first row's reference; the "12-byte
  header" and "one record per manager" were misreads.
- Row: `[u32 manager history reference][date start][date end][u32][u32][u16 W][u16 D]
  [u16 L][u8 kind][u8 ×4]`. Dates are packed game dates (low 9 bits day of year, high
  bits time slot — the "counter" words of the old model). Start `00 00 e7 07` (1,270 rows)
  = null start. The u32 in "`cc 02 00 00` (club 716)" was a manager reference; no
  St Albans row exists — the human's spell is still open, and open spells are not rows.
- ls = league-ls grammar (`tad.` v4, free count 0, 6,004 lists, delta `v[m]+v[m-1]`
  past the 8-byte head, trailer `0, 31, 2`). Every row in exactly one list; lists are
  teams, numbered in the order of each team's FIRST row (list i's first offset is
  strictly increasing in i), so the number carries no identity. Rows within a list are
  that team's managers in order (start = previous end on 78% of consecutive pairs; the
  rest are vacancies).
- Append-only confirmed again: v03 (Nov 8) and v02 (Nov 14) dt are byte prefixes of
  New's, and their ls lists are prefixes of New's lists (5,993 → 6,004 lists).

**Validation (GT save):** W/D/L: for the 5,724 managers whose rows + current job sum to
career games, summed wins and losses equal `ManagerCareerRecord` 5,724/5,724. Longest
club window reproduced exactly (team+start+end) 7,525/8,537 (88.1%; 97.9% of windows
that are not pre-2023), shortest 5,353/7,462 (71.7%; 90.1%). Team naming: 2,551 lists
pinned by career-record windows (0 conflicts), 83.6% of rows; holdout vs the v03
snapshot (pins from pre-snapshot rows only): 190/190 appended rows in pinned lists name
the team of the manager's v03 current job, 0 wrong. Karl: no ended spell; open spell team
603 from 2023-07-18, 741 games 391-131-219. 16,530 managers with ≥1 spell, 6,387 with >1
(4,156 with spells at ≥2 named teams).

**Ruled out (do not redo):**
- `non_pl_hist_dt` is NOT the same spells: 8 B head + 287,455 × 20-byte rows
  `[u32 subject][date][date][01 00 6c 07][4 B code]`; masked-date join to manager rows:
  411 hits on 21,429 rows, none with the team/club as subject (pre-game staff history).
- Spell date pairs (raw and slot-masked) appear in no other section
  (person_record_history_dt, pl_hist_dt, tc_history_dt, non_pl_hist_dt) and never next
  to the team/club/manager in game_db.
- List number stored next to the team or club: no fixed offset within club records
  (record spans), ±6,000 B around the club's status uid pair (600 lists), ±600 B
  around every one of the 17.8M game_db occurrences of a pinned list number (targets:
  team id, team id ±1, club uid, club uid − 1, and the club's league-history list
  number; best offset reaches 132 of 1,986 lists, symmetric ±460/±230 = table
  periodicity, i.e. noise), or anywhere in manager_manager / person_record_manager /
  tc_history_dt (same histogram, ≤7 lists at any offset). Team objects that do not
  carry their own team id remain the untested possibility.
- Chain rule (list's last end date == a team's current manager's start date, unique on
  both sides): 5-fold CV 672 right / 34 wrong (95%) — not integrated.
- `kind` byte: 10 = short spells (median 17 days, 2 games), 6 = long with ~1 game; not
  pinned. Bytes +27/+28 vs career league titles/cups: 84%/88% of non-zero managers;
  +29 vs record word_151 and +30 vs word_157 ~89–90%: none exact, left in `unknown`.

**Next steps:** name the 3,453 unpinned lists (mostly one-row lists: 3,080): find where a
team stores its manager-history list number (team objects are not located by fmsave;
the league/cup/best-eleven lists have the same problem); or a second pass using the
chain rule constrained by the pinned lists. The old open-spell scan
(`career_manager_spells()` / `ManagerSpell`) misread these rows (its "club" is a manager
reference); **removed 2026-10-11** on the owner's say-so, `manager_spells()` replaces it.

#### Superseded model (kept for the record; wrong except the append-only diff)
- Header: `03 01 'tmc.' 02 00 30 1f 00 00 01 00`, records follow (12-byte header).
- One record per manager in the game world: the wire pattern `00 0a 00 00 00 00`
  occurs 8,178 times against the header count of 7,984 (a handful of extra
  occurrences inside record bodies). Only the spell-start row is decoded:
  `<u32 club> u16 day u16 season u16 u16 same-season ff*8` — the all-unset tail is
  the shape a spell still open carries. Spells that HAVE ended use an undecoded
  shape, so `career_manager_spells` covers open spells only (195 rows on the
  ground truth, every one season 2022-2024 — an import-boundary artifact, since
  only pre-import-era spells carry that shape by 2037).
- APPEND-ONLY confirmed by diffing saves 10 matchdays apart (Nov 14 → Dec 4 2037):
  the old 793,856 B section is an exact byte prefix of the new 799,746 B one
  (+5,890 B of appended records, ~1.1 KB per matchday: rows for every new spell/result
  in the game world).
- Year words are u16 LE right in the data (e.g. `e6 07` = 2022, `98 00` = day 152
  ≈ June 1, `b6 00` = 182 ≈ July 1 — season start dates).
- 31-byte record model (from appended records and the managed-spell row @0x36c4):
  `[u32 id/ref][u16 day][u16 year][u16 counter][u16 year2][00 ff x8 sentinels][u16 x4][00 00 00]`
- The managed-spell row: `00 0a 00 00 00 00 | cc 02 00 00 (club 716) | b6 00 (day 182)
  | e7 07 (2023) | 4e 6f | e7 07 (2023) | ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | 05 00 06 00 08 00 02 00
  | b9 4a 00 00 | ce 3b 00 00 ...` — joined 18/7/2023 matches day 182/2023.
- Year-word frequency 2022..2037 ≈ 3,000-4,000 records/year → rows for every managed
  spell per manager per season, whole game world.
- Persons here are NOT referenced by their 0x775648bf-style uid or by the pids from
  hall_of_fame (searched, zero hits) — reference encoding still unknown.


### tc_record_man (tad., 22,737,139 B)
- Header: `03 01 'tad.' 18 00 | u32 5 | ff * 24 | u32 22 | u32 ... | u32 6 ...`
- Body is a stream of small records with a repeating 17-byte unit:
  `03 00 00 00 | 00 | 01 00 | 6c 07 | 01 00 | 6c 07 | 00 00 00 00`
  (u32 = 3, then u16 pairs where 1900 = the null-year sentinel from comp_history).
- NOT append-only: save-diff v03 (Nov 8 2037) → v02 (Nov 14) → Dec 3 → Dec 4 shows
  a mid-file insertion (+204 B between Nov 8 and Nov 14; +1,067 B Nov 14 → Dec 3;
  Dec 3 → Dec 4 byte-identical). Post-import seasons (2023/24 → 2037/38) accumulate
  here at matchday granularity.
- 11-byte appended event records (from the diffs):
  `84/85/8c/9e 87 00 00 | e4..f1 af 03 00 (incrementing seq u16 base 0xafe4) | 01|02 | value u16s (~20,3xx; 50/32 for zeroed) | 84 …`.
- Club references here use uid 717 for Stafford Rangers (club uid 717/unique_id 718)?
  no — see correction: `unique_id = uid + 1` holds for EVERY club (fmsave Club rows:
  St. Albans cid 716 unique 717, Stafford 717/718), so a u32 717 in tc_record_man is
  simply the club AFTER St. Albans in uid space (Stafford Rangers). The St. Albans
  rows are the 47 u32-716 hits in the same `… 00 08 01 00 00 00 …` record grammar.
- u32 payloads (record ids like 2593, 3486) appear as bytes only ~100-183 times each
  across 22.7 MB — u16 collision-level noise, so they are NOT raw literals there;
  likely indexes into offset-sized arrays or reconstructed at load.
- 12-byte record grammar in the appended end region (current season, ids ~235,300):
  `[u32 club][u32 id][u8 m][u8 n][0x4f][0x00]` — ids globally sequential across
  clubs (710…724 around club 716; a run of 115 records decodes: ids 235,286-235,400,
  modes m mostly 1, occasionally 2/3/4/5/7; n ∈ {50…100} in 5-steps). Club 716's 13
  records run 100→80 descending in 5-steps — a percentage meter (fan/board
  confidence?) updated per match: 13 records ≈ the matches to the in-game date.
  The `4f` byte is constant in this family; n's 5-step quantisation looks like a
  0-100 scale value. Semantics unconfirmed.
- The 47 scattered u32-716 hits elsewhere use wider record families (context shows
  `[u32 club][u16 ?][u16 year]` with years 2032-2037 around, and the club byte before
  the u32 varying) — a full tc_record_man decode is its own project.

### hall_of_fame — INTEGRATED (persons + honours decoders live in the package)

`src/fmsave/readers/career_history.py` (exposed via `Save.career_persons()`,
`Save.career_honours()` and the `fmsave career-history` command) reads:
- 5,413 person records with inline names, birth dates and person uids.
- 897 honours rows (99 pass only with looser tail rules; both keep club 716's four).

**Person records** (variable-length names, walked forward from every
`flag + u32 length` pair whose tail passes the bounds):

```
[01|00] u32 len1 "first" u32 len2 "last"
00 00 00 00                     <- 4 zero bytes
u16 dob_day_of_year             (0x4c = 76 = 17 March for the manager)
u16 birth_year                  (0x7c2 = 1986)
u32 shared/non-id               (0x1f6442 = 2,057,282 for the manager's FM24 copy,
                                 0xffffffff for some records — unset)
u32 person_uid                  (0x775648bf manager; 0x77554473 for the FM24 copy)
01 fd 02 00 00 07 03 03 ...     <- node id 765 + varying tail bytes
```

- Person blocks vary after the birth fields: some carry an 8-byte ff sentinel +
  `00 <u32 node>` instead of a ref/uid pair, and node ids other than 765 exist
  (f3 02 = 755 seen), so the forward names+fields scan keys on the birth-date pair,
  not on the node constant.
- Both manager records decode (Karl Hudgell, dob 76/1986, uids 0x77554473 and
  0x775648bf) alongside 5,400+ historical people (Dave Bassett, John Coleman...).

**Honours rows** — refined grammar (the earlier "3 03 00 tail" note only covered 101
of the rows): `<u32 club> 01 00 <u32 comp> fd 02 00 00 02 00 <u16 count> 01 [01 00 |
04 01 00] <u16s> <u16 season@node+13> <varies>`, 897 rows, 426 clubs. The season is
ALWAYS the u16 at node id + 13, and it is the year the honour was won (2025 = the
2024/25 season). The bytes after the season differ row to row (03 03 00 only 284 of
897; 00 00 00, 02 00 00, 0a 00 00 ... also appear) — do not anchor on a tail.
One arithmetic correction: comp 0x4e2bef = **5,123,055**, not 5,121,759 as an earlier
note had it.

- The manager's honours follow (4 rows, all club 716):

| comp id | season | matches ground truth |
|---|---|---|
| 0x4e2bef = 5,123,055 | 2025 (`e9 07`) | Vanarama NLS title (recreated-comp id space) |
| 0x1aa92 = 109,202 | 2025 | FA Trophy |
| 0x1aa91 = 109,201 | 2026 | Vanarama National League title |
| 0x0d = 13 | 2029 | Sky Bet League One title |

(The season year stored is the year the honour was won — the season's final year:
2025 = the 2024/25 season.)

- The value 0x8e56e3 = 9,331,427 is NOT a person id (shared by two unrelated
  persons). True person uids are the 0x77xxxxxx u32s.
- uid convention: hall_of_fame stores the manager uid as 0x775648bf; game_db stores
  0x775648be (fmsave person_id = selector − 1 offset). Search history sections for
  the +1 variant.
- Inline names exist here (`04 00 00 00`="Karl", `07 00 00 00`="Hudgell"), so person
  blocks in "tad." sections can embed names directly; other sections reference by uid.

### tc_cup_history_dt / _ls — RE-FRAMED: per-team cup history (2026-10-10, scratch `fm26-career/tmp_cups/a*.py`)
- **The first reader was misaligned (dead end, do not revive):** it read 18-byte rows
  from offset 4, so its "club" u32 was the previous row's last field (row 0's "club
  77411" was the header bytes `'c.' 01 00`) and the "comp" values looked like French
  Cup stages under St Albans. The head is 8 bytes (`03 01 'tmc.' 01 00`); (len−8) % 18
  == 0 exactly (165,490 rows) and the ls trailer's record size is 18.
- **Row (INTEGRATED, `Save.career_cup_entries()`):**
  `[u32 stage_id][u16 start_year][u16 end_year][u8 result][u8 method][u16 word]
  [u8 position][u8 0][u32 opponent TEAM id]`.
  - stage_id: `stages()` id of the stage the campaign ENDED in (proven: Brazilian
    clubs' lists hold Brazilian Cup / Northeast Regional stages, an African nation's
    list holds ACON / WC-African-qualifying stages, St Albans' holds FA Trophy/FA Cup/
    Carabao/Vertu stages).
  - years: calendar start/end of the season (2024, 2025 for 2024/25; equal for
    calendar-year comps); end_year = the honours season. 99.95% have end−start ∈ 0..2,
    62 rows 3, ~20 rows carry a junk/unset end year.
  - opponent: a **team id** (`Club.teams[].team_id`), not a club uid — team 603 =
    St Albans' first team, team 716 = FC Gueugnon (that was the "St Albans in the
    French Cup" illusion). 0xffffffff on league-format rows.
  - word: 0xffff on 98.7%; 633/637/635/2610… on the rest, open.
  - byte at +15 is always 0.
- **Codes (checked against stored fixture scores, 2034/35–2036/37):**
  result 3 = won the competition (192 W + 50 drawn→pens; row = final, opponent =
  beaten finalist); 2 = knocked out by opponent (6,020 L); 0 + no opponent =
  league-format stage, `position` = placing (0 occurs → likely 0-based, unconfirmed);
  1 = tie won (51 W), meaning open. method 1 = normal time, 2 = extra time, 3 =
  penalties (940/940 drawn fixture scores), 7 = two legs (Carabao semis, old WC
  qualifying), 8 = 154 rows open, 255 = league-format.
- **ls:** shared list grammar (`decode_league_history_lists` works unchanged:
  absolute offsets = 8 + delta-decoded value). 10,601 lists, **one per team**, every
  row in exactly one list; lists ordered by their first row, team NOT stored.
  Verified by fixtures: owner = other side of the fixture at (stage, season,
  opponent) → single owner for 4,524/5,405 lists with fixtures, owner ≠ opponent.
- **Club pinning (INTEGRATED, `Save.club_cup_history(uid)`):** hall-of-fame cup
  honour (club, database comp, season) → internal comp → the unique result-3 row
  with that competition_id (joined from `stages()`) and end_year → its list. 34 clubs
  pin on the ground-truth save; **St Albans = list 3643** (54 rows 2023/24–2036/37),
  FA Trophy 2024/25 = stage 4491 (round 19, final) result 3 vs Bath City ✓; FA Cup
  exits each season (Enfield, QPR, Cardiff, Norwich, WBA, Leicester, Wrexham,
  Newcastle, Ipswich, Man UFC (ET), Forest, Brighton, Man UFC).
- Open: result 1 / method 8 / `word` meaning; position base; mapping lists to teams
  without a cup honour (fixtures cover only 2034+; a team-record history index in
  game_db not found).

### non_pl_hist_dt — manager spells (pre-career chain)
- Records: `01 0b 00 00 | <u32 subject> | <u16 day1> <u16 year1> | <u16 day2> <u16
  year2> | 01 00 6c 07` (1900 end-sentinel when spell not ended).
- St. Albans spells from FM24-era data appear here (`cc 02 00 00 | day/year …`),
  e.g. spells ending 2022 (`f5 00 e0 07 00 00 e6 07` = 272→356 2016, 2022…). This
  section carries the non-league/pre-import manager chains.

### award_year_hist_dt — RE-FRAMED: 82-byte records, 3 placing slots (2026-10-10, scratch `fm26-career/tmp_cups/b*.py`)
- **The 26/30-byte streaming model was a misread (dead end):** the section is
  `03 01 'tmc.' 01 00` + 31,459 × 82-byte records exactly (ls trailer record size
  82). Record = `[u16 year][u16 award_index]` + 3 × 26-byte slots
  `[u32 winner][u32 club][u8 age][10 B][02][u32 flags][u16 tag]`; slot 0 = winner,
  1 = runner-up, 2 = third; empty slot = winner 0xffffffff (filled-slot counts per
  record: 1:16,274, 3:14,155, 2:594, 0:436). The old "[02][flags][tag]" head was the
  PREVIOUS record's last slot tail; the old "head-less monthly rows" were slots 1/2;
  the old "(1937, 4, 716)" club-history row was a misread winner u32 (0x00040791) of
  a slot whose club is 716 — no such record exists.
- INTEGRATED (`Save.career_awards()`): one `Award` per filled slot with `placing`;
  59,927 rows (31,023 / 14,748 / 14,156 by placing). Tag = slot's own closing u16,
  0x8b (139, England's nation id) on every manager slot.
- Manager (ref 328408) slots: 2025 award 2177 (NLS Manager of the Season) placing 1 =
  the biography's runner-up ✓; 2026/144, 2027/103, 2029/101, 2031/99, 2034/99 placing
  0; ages 39/40/41/43/45/48.
- `award_year_hist_ls`: 1,029 lists, **one per award index** (no list mixes ids).
- **Monthly awards are NOT in this section:** zero records for every Manager of the
  Month index (98/100/102/104/142/2181).

- **Winner → person join SOLVED (2026-10-10, scan d3_*), integrated as
  `Save.history_person_reference(uid)`.** A person's `game_db` object closes
  with `[u32 ref][u32 unique_id][u32 unique_id]` (unique_id = uid + 1; the
  same sound-header convention `player_scan.closing_unique_id` uses), and
  `ref` is the winner id award rows carry: manager staff uid 2002143422 →
  header (328408, 2002143423 ×2) → his 5 season award rows (144, 103, 101,
  99 ×2). Lookup 0.35 s per person. Noise: values ≥ 2^24 before a doubled
  uid (e.g. 0x05000000) are unrelated data and are filtered. Players resolve
  too (Dumas → 189608, one award row). Note this award-section reference
  space is NOT person_record_history's refC (Dumas 0xb604 there).

### Monthly manager awards — location OPEN (2026-10-10)
The manager has 19 awards in-game; the yearly history holds 6 placings. Ruled out:
- award_year_hist_dt (see above: no monthly award index at all).
- **award_man** (`tad.`, 842,938 B) is NOT award definitions/history: it holds
  current-period voting shortlists (records with ~10 candidates and float ratings,
  e.g. 0x417cee2f ≈ 15.8) — no 328408 anywhere in it.
- u32 328408 across all 80 sections: hits in game_db (2,489, mostly relationship
  tables `… 06 00 03 01 64 00 00 ff <ref>` and staff-permission tables), news,
  transfer_man, manager_manager (staff-search rows), interaction/press-conference,
  scout_man, player_stats_hist_dt, edit_session_man — none in an award shape.
- u32 award database ids (107386/107388/107390/114797/29023490): noise-level counts.
- award index adjacent to year 2023–2037 in game_db: no cluster matching even the
  known season awards. tc_manager_history_dt / non_pl_hist_dt: no award fields.
- person_record_history_dt: no records for the manager's refC (0x48bf).
- **person_record_manager** = the human manager's event log (170 entries, all
  his): `[u8 type] 15 ff×6 [u32 328408] 00 [u32 team 603] [u16 packed date: low 9
  bits = day-of-year][u16 year][u16 sub][u16 importance] … [u16 season @+30]
  [u16 award_index @+32]`. Type 5 = award won: 2181 NLS Manager of the Month (2023,
  sub 0x17, importance 35) and the 5 season awards (sub 0x16, importance 85). Only
  ONE monthly award is in the log, so it is filtered/pruned, not complete.
Next: ~~decode the manager's game_db staff object~~ (done differently: career totals are
in person_record_manager's record table — see "Manager career statistics" below; the
game_db triple at 248,297,587 opens a stub, not a career object). The per-season
job-history award counts 1,2,2,2,1,2,1,?,1,1,2 are still unlocated.

### Manager career statistics — INTEGRATED (`Save.career_manager_records()`, `Save.manager_career(uid)`; 2026-10-10, scratch `fm26-career/tmp_manager/h*.py`, `v*.py`)
**Where they live:** `person_record_manager` (4,394,626 B, `tad.` v30). After the human
event log (bytes 14..10,807 on the GT save; 170 entries for ref 328408) the section is a
table of **fixed 367-byte records, one per person who has managed** (11,945 on GT),
ascending history reference, butted to a 4-byte `ff ff ff ff` trailer. Found by searching
u32 1589/1059 and u16 741/391/219 near each other (two hits = the career and current-job
blocks of ref 328408's record @3,311,605). Full layout: `docs/reference/manager_career.md`.
- **2026-10-15, a save started in FM26 (Fethiyespor, pre-season):** the records are not
  fixed. After the doubled ref come three flagged slots (`01` + 204-byte career block, or
  `00`) and a 152-byte current-job tail: slot 1 men's, slot 2 women's (new in FM26), slot 3
  never filled. GT has slot 1 only, hence 367 B. 5,631 records, some out of reference
  order; the old back-walk read only the last 99 (it stopped at the first 163/571-B one).
- Record = `[ref][ref]01`, career fee extremes (+9 paid, +32 received: `[player ref][date]
  [u32 £][u16][from team][u8][to team]`), 4 spell slots @+55 (longest/shortest club,
  longest/shortest national: `[u8][team][date][date]`), u64 spent/received/agent fees
  @+107, u32 GF/GA @+131, u16 cups/league titles @+147, u16 games/W/L @+163, u16 awards
  @+193, bought/sold/released @+199, u8 club/national jobs @+209, then a current-job block
  (fees with a different field order @+215/+238, job start date @+260, team @+269,
  money/goals/counters @+286..+339). **Draws are not stored** (game derives G−W−L).
- Dates are real packed game dates (`_scan.decode_date`: low 9 bits day-of-year,
  1-based), not the (day-of-season, year) pairs other history sections use.
- **GT validation — every Managerial Stats number matches:** 741 games, 391W/131D
  (derived)/219L, GF 1589, GA 1059, 1 club job / 0 national, longest spell 18/7/2023 →
  4/12/2037 = 5,253 days, shortest 0 days (slot unset), 19 awards, 127 bought, £101M
  spent (101,492,665), 39 sold, 50 released, cups 1, league wins 3, agent fees £2.4M
  (2,406,906), highest fee paid £23M = 22,937,564 for ref 189608 = Corentin Dumas on
  10/8/2036 (St-Etienne team 706 → 603), highest received £32.5M = 32,347,260 for ref
  280836 = Ben Young-Thomas on **9/8/2037** (GT note had "2036?"; screen shows 9/8/20..),
  603 → Shanghai Port. Current job: team 603 (St Albans), start 18/7/2023, same totals.
  (FM's display rounds £10–100M to the nearest £0.5M: 22.94→£23M, 32.35→£32.5M.)
- Population checks (11,945): W+L ≤ games always; current-job games ≤ career games;
  longest club spell ≥ shortest (7,550/7,550); slots 3–4 are non-club teams 228/229;
  current-job team = `Staff.team_id` for 1,096/1,138 staff with one (rest = other roles).
- **Correction to the fee-hunt closure:** the save DOES store fees for the record
  transfers (career extremes here) and, in the human event log, for logged transfers
  (type-2 entries: `[from team][u8 0][to team][player ref][u32 fee]`, e.g. Dumas entry
  @9,948 carries 22,937,564). The closure still holds for a complete per-transfer store.
- Open: `money_received` (+115/+294) = £97,733,168 but the screen shows "Total Sold
  Transfer Value £0". Unknown words on the GT record: +151=5 (plausibly promotions —
  5 since 2025), +155=3, +159=1, +171=21, +173=42, +177=18, +195=13, +197=5, +318=2600,
  +340=5 (exposed as `unknown["word_<offset>"]`). The screen rows below "League Wins"
  were not captured; a screenshot of the full Overall table would pin them.

**Dead ends (do not redo):**
- The game_db header `[328408][2002143423][2002143423]` @248,297,587 is followed by kind
  byte 08 and a ~70-byte stub, then ref 328409's header — it is a stub person object, not
  the close of a career object. The human's own object is ref **328407** / uid 2002143422
  / kind 9 @241,959,697, ending at that header (6.34 MB). Probes of it for 716/603/years:
  sequential club-id lists, float tables, `0d 00 ff ff ff ff 00 01 00 6c 07…` repeated
  records — no career totals (they are in person_record_manager).
- `humans` (27 KB) = UI view/filter preferences (`tslf`, `fptatlif`, `daqstlif` tags) —
  no career data.
- Per-season Job History rows (league/position/awards/trophies): stride searches for the
  season-year run (u16 2023..2030, any stride 2–400) and for the per-season sequences
  (awards 1,2,2,2,1,2,1,?,1,1,2,0,0,0; positions 3,1,1,3,7,1,9,3,7,5,2,12,12,11; u8/u16,
  both orders, stride 1–300) found nothing in person_record_manager, tc_manager_history_dt,
  tc_manager_history_ls or manager_manager; game_db year runs are person-header uid
  coincidences. tc_manager_history_dt is append-only, so per-season rows would be
  scattered, not strided — the next lead is decoding its record family keyed via
  `tc_manager_history_ls` (2026-10-11: decoded — one row per ENDED spell, no per-season
  rows; the lead is closed). Positions per season
  already come from `club_league_history(716)`; trophies per season from honours; the
  per-season award counts remain the only Job History column without a source.
- Event log (first part of person_record_manager): now INTEGRATED — see "Manager event
  log" below. It is importance-pruned (1 of the monthly awards), so it cannot give
  per-season award counts.
- Profile fields not found yet: coaching licence (Continental B, studying A), preferred
  formations (4-4-2, 4-4-2 2DM), tactical style (Control Possession), reputation (Global).
  Nationality is already `Staff.nation_id` = 139 (England); wage/contract/DOB/personality
  are in `staff()`. Licence etc. probably live in the kind-9 human object; no anchor value
  is known for them (enum ids), so a diff of two saves around a badge/formation change is
  the practical way in.

### Manager event log — INTEGRATED (`Save.manager_events(uid)`; 2026-10-10, scratch `fm26-career/tmp_fees/e*.py`, `p*.py`, `v*.py`)
**Framing SOLVED** (replaces the head-pattern split, which merged 16 entries whose head
pair at +2 is set and mis-read type-2 lengths as 58/59): section head `03 01 tad. 1e00`,
`u8 01`, **u32 log count @9** (1), then per log `u8 01, u32 reference, u32 TOP-LEVEL entry
count` (141 @18 on GT), entries. Entry = 31-byte head + **payload of fixed length per type**
(1:18 2:27 3:10 4:13 5:3 6:16 7:12 8:54 9:18 11:20 13:13 16:18 17:21). **Type 18 is a
group**: `u32 child count`, the children, one closing byte (0..3) — that closing byte is
the "59th byte" seen on the last child of each signing run. The walk ends exactly at
10,807 = first career record (ref 7); 186 entries, 45 inside 15 groups.
- Head: `[u8 type][u8 15][u16][u32]` (the pair is ff on 170 entries, set on 16 match /
  attendance / record entries, e.g. (82, 271670) twice — meaning open) `[u32 ref] 00
  [u32 team] [date] [u16 sub] [u16 importance] 00 [u8: 0/5/8/13/23/24] 00 01 [u16 season
  start year]`.
- Type 2 payload: `00 [from|ffffffff] 00 [to] [player ref] [u32 fee £] [u16] [date effective
  | 1/1/1900] 00 00 00`. Long-entry "nonsense refs" in the old scan were neighbouring
  entries, not other layouts — every type-2 entry is 27 bytes.
- Validated: 72/77 type-2 entries have a `club_player_moves(716)` row for the player and
  destination on the entry date or the effective date (rest: 3 sub-30 season-end entries,
  Kitić's superseded pre-agreement, Zedníček effective 1/1/2038). 17 distinct fee moves
  (table in `docs/reference/manager_events.md`); sub 4 / 58 = successive club record fees
  paid / received. Young-Thomas £2.7M "24/6/2035" is a sub-30 entry dated at season end,
  not the transfer (transfer_man: 3/8/2034). Honours: type 1 sub 1 `u16 @+4` = `Honour.count`
  (46/53/72/107); sub 17 value 111 = 2024/25 VNS points (ground truth). Awards: type 5 =
  the 5 `career_awards` winner rows + monthly 2181; type 6 = player awards whose value
  matches the award row's tail stat (4/4 checkable). Promotions: type 4, comp 10→9→8→7.
- Competition ids in the log: the match entries' own-league u16 (+46) runs 708 (2023-25)
  → 150 (2025/26) → 10 → 9 → 8 → 7 with the club's divisions, so 708 = VNS, 150 = VNL,
  10 L2, 9 L1, 8 CH, 7 PL; 151 (honour won Sunday 11/5/2025) = FA Trophy; 667 (a type-16
  entry in L2 season 2026/27) unresolved. They are NOT the `career_honours` ids (5123055, 109202, 109201, 13); join by the
  honour counter instead.
- Open: payloads of types 3 (milestones/money), 7 (attendance? stadium, old, new), 11,
  13, 16 (runs? comp, count, two dates), 17; type-1 sub-1 refs @+6/+10 and u16 @+14
  (e.g. 2025 VNS: Harvey White, Shiloh Remy, 17 — captain/top scorer? unproven); type-8
  bytes beyond score/opponent (+28 match competition, +42 stadium, +46/+48 own/opponent
  league, +50 = 100s on milestone matches); several human managers untested.

### award_club_hist_dt (23,984 B) — structure seen, not decoded
- Uniform ~37-byte records `[u16 year][u16 award][00][u16 club][ff-padded tail]`,
  years 2005→2037, ~640 records, no club-716 rows; ids and the club id space differ
  from award_year_hist_dt. Left undecoded (field level) for now.

## tc_league_history_dt / tc_league_history_ls — DECODED, rows threaded to clubs

Integrated as `Save.career_league_history()` (reference:
`docs/reference/league_history.md`). dt = 24-byte rows on an 8-mod-24 grid;
ls = one delta-encoded row list per club (checkpoint 5 below), surfaced as
each row's `history_index`. Checkpoint 4 records the reader-bug fixes; read
its anchor list together with checkpoint 5's correction. Checkpoint 7 pins 2,791
lists to clubs (`Save.league_history_clubs()`, `Save.league_history_table()`).

### Where this stands (checkpoint 4, 2026-10-09: validated against ground truth)

Checkpoint 3's decoder landed but **had never run**: every struct format string
read `'<H>'`/`'<I>'` (stray `>`), so `decode_league_history` raised
`struct.error` on first call. Fixed; the reader now runs end-to-end and was
validated on the ground-truth save (analysis extracts under
`/home/karl/fm26-career/tmp_validation/`).

**Reader bugs fixed this round (all pre-integration, in
`src/fmsave/readers/career_history.py` + wiring):**
- `struct.error` from `'<H>'`/`'<I>'` format strings (7 call sites) — decode
  crashed on any input.
- `decode_awards` referenced undefined `winner_age` in both dedup keys
  (`NameError`); its own tests failed since the commit landed. Fixed (`age`).
- `Save.career_league_history` docstring claimed per-managed-club data; it is
  every club's rows. Rewritten. `LeagueHistorySeason` was never exported
  (`fmsave.__all__`, `models.__all__`) and `save.md :members:` was missing
  `career_league_history` — the doc test would have failed; all fixed, model
  docstring brought to record standard (Attributes + unconfirmed markers).

**Validation results (decoder output vs `docs/ground-truth.md`):**
> **Superseded by checkpoint 5:** only the 2023/24 (0x720ce0) and 2024/25
> (0x730a60) rows below are St Albans'; the other anchors are other clubs'
> rows. Use list 351 (checkpoint 5) for the real chain.
- All five anchor rows decode exactly: 2024/25 VNS 1st (111 pts,
  GF 129 = news item's 2.80/game × 46) at dt 0x730a60 comp 708; 2028/29 L1 1st
  (P34 W20 D7 L7 67) at 0x775e98 comp 13; 2029/30 Championship 5th (76) at
  0x7815b0 comp 10; 2032/33 5th (75) at 0x7b1628; 2033/34 2nd (87) at 0x7c1360.
- Further rows found by table uniqueness (one row per (season, comp, pos)):
  2023/24 VNS 3rd at 0x720ce0 (season-2024 comp-708 table, 24 rows, complete
  3-point stats — checkpoint 2's "W21 D14 L9, 2-pt era" expectation was wrong;
  the imported 2023/24 table is stored recomputed at 3 points, pos 2 row reads
  W26 D8 L12 117-71 86 pts); 2025/26 NL 1st → season-2026 comp **707**
  (0x740270, W34 D7 L5 109; comp 708 carries the same season's other tables);
  2027/28 L1 7th at 0x7665e0 (comp 13 pos 6/18, W13 D13 L8, 52);
  2031/32 Championship 7th at 0x7a16e0 (comp 10 pos 6/24, 69).
- Every decoded club-relevant row satisfies W+D+L=P and Pts=3W+D. The season
  2025 comp-708 runner-up reads 96 pts (the news item's Worthing), as expected.
- Season word = season-**ending** year (2025 = 2024/25), on every anchor.
- No rows exist for the current (2037/38) season — it lives in the live
  `league_tables()` section, which is correct, and 2030/31 has a full comp-10
  table (the GT screenshot gap; club position not pinned by the screenshots).
- Volume: 339,481 rows kept of 348,756 grid slots on this save (97.3%);
  241,872 consistent 3-point rows + 75,151 consistent 2-point (pre-import);
  ~22,458 rows fail some arithmetic: 6,290 unplayed tables (P=255, zeroed
  results), 2,324 rows with P=255 sentinel + real W/D/L, 13,844 with
  W+D+L consistent but points fitting neither rule (mostly old-era comps
  122/123 rows from other record shapes), 51 rows with the null-year sentinel
  1900; 5,671 duplicate (season, comp, pos) keys (mostly pre-import, plus
  ~2.4k in import-era seasons). Post-import rows (2024+) all carry
  team_ref 0xffffffff — club attribution comes from the ls (checkpoint 5).

**Pinned in `tests/test_career_league_history.py`:** the 24-byte row grammar and
grid walk, sanity bands (season 1899/2101 rejected, pos>=size rejected,
sizes 1/101 rejected, all-255 results block rejected), the unplayed-table row
is kept raw, no points-rule enforcement (2-pt and neither-rule rows read
through). Checkpoint 5 replaced the ls tests: delta decode, row → list
number, unparseable index → `history_index` None.
Save-derived values are deliberately not committed (CONTRIBUTING guardrail);
the anchor offsets above are the re-verification recipe on the ground-truth
save.

### tc_league_history_ls — CRACKED: per-club row lists (checkpoint 5, 2026-10-10; scans d1_*)

Scratch scripts: `/home/karl/fm26-career/tmp_leagues/d1_*.py`; per-save
extracts in `tmp_leagues/alt/` (v03 → v02 → base/new/bak saves).

**Generic `_ls` grammar (holds for all 12 `*_ls` sections, exact parse):**
```
03 01 'tad.' 04 00          8 B
u32 0
u32 list_count              (league: 19,514)
list_count x { u32 n ; n x u32 value }
u32 0 ; u32 dt_record_size ; u16 dt_header_version     10-B trailer
```
Σn equals the paired `_dt` record count in every section checked (league
348,756 = (len−8)/24; cup 165,490; nation records 3,192; award_club 648).

**Values are delta-encoded:** row offset `y_m = x_m + x_(m−1)` (`y_0 = x_0`),
relative to the dt payload (byte 8). With that decode **every one of the
348,756 dt rows is referenced exactly once**, all aligned, and **all 19,514
lists come out in non-decreasing season order**. (XOR instead of add: 45%
aligned, wrong.) The raw values looked like two interleaved monotone streams
— that is purely the alternating-sum artefact; ignore it.

**A list = one club's full league history**, proven three ways:
- Save diffs (v03→v02 +59 rows, v02→base +162): the dt is append-only, and
  each appended row adds exactly one value to exactly one list (the decoded
  new last element = the appended row's offset, every time).
- TPS (list 385): its 41-row pre-import block is Veikkausliiga comp 171
  1980–2022, then 2023–2037; the v02 append is its 2037 title row.
- **St Albans = list 351** on the GT save, chain matches ground truth on
  every pinned season: 2023/24 VNS 3rd (c708, 86 pts), 2024/25 VNS 1st
  (111), 2025/26 National 1st (**c150**, 89), 2026/27 L2 3rd (**c10**),
  2027/28 L1 7th (**c9**), 2028/29 L1 1st (93), 2031/32 Ch 7th (**c8**),
  2032/33 5th, 2033/34 2nd (87), 2034/35 PL 12th (**c7** = live table comp
  7), 2035/36 12th, 2036/37 11th. Fills the GT gaps: **2029/30 Ch 9th
  (68 pts), 2030/31 Ch 3rd (89)**. Pre-import rows 1974–2022 (+ FM24-era
  2023, 2024 rows with P2 byte = 0) precede them.
- **Correction:** checkpoint 4's anchors for 2025/26 (comp 707, 109 pts),
  2027/28 (comp 13), 2028/29 (comp 13, P34), 2029/30 (comp 10, 5th),
  2031/32 (comp 10) and 2032/33 / 2033/34 (0x7b1628 / 0x7c1360, list 345)
  were **other clubs' rows** that happened to fit the positions. English
  comps are VNS 708, National 150, L2 10, L1 9, Ch 8, PL 7.
- Row byte +13 (the "duplicate P") is 0 on pre-import rows and = P on
  post-import rows — a clean import-era discriminator. Row +8 (`ref`) is
  non-null on 12,024 rows (mostly pre-1930 spans, e.g. 15966): an
  alias/predecessor id, **not** the owning club.

**List index → club (ordering solved, membership OPEN):**
- Lists 0–19,295 have their first row in the pre-import region; their row
  blocks sit back-to-back in list order (0 inversions). Lists 19,296–19,513
  (218) start post-import, appended in first-row order (= clubs whose first
  league season came after the import).
- Head lists follow **club uid order** among clubs that have a list: 162 exact
  anchors from the two save diffs (new row ↔ unique live-table stat match),
  0 inversions below uid 2e9 (2 inversions are tail lists). Not
  `club_index` order (2 inversions, and gaps don't fit).
- Which clubs get a list is NOT derivable yet: 33,001 clubs vs 19,296 head
  lists. Albania/Angola/Estonia/Faroe have none (13 clubs before Platense
  = list 12, 6 between St Albans and HJK), but 96 nations are mixed (e.g.
  Argentina 493 listed / 840 not), with no correlation to
  last_league_position, parent club, or live-table presence.
- Ruled out as the membership/pointer source: a list-index field in the club
  record (u16/u32, fixed offset from start, end or team-list end, ±3 KB);
  nation-only membership; `last_league_position` (refers to differing
  seasons per league, e.g. HJK 2 vs 2037 row 5th); live-table membership
  (only 3,156 clubs).
- Banded DP alignment (anchors hard, comp→nation from live tables +
  EM, live-table vs recent-row, llp match) reproduces 76/77 held-out
  anchors — but the held-out set is all live clubs, so this is **not** a
  basis for naming historical-only clubs. Not integrated.

**Checkpoint 6 (2026-10-10, scans d2_*): uid → list number solved for titled
clubs, integrated as `Save.club_league_history(uid)`.** Hall-of-fame honours
store the competition's **editor database id** (L1 = 13 → internal 9; National
109201 → 150; VNS 5123055 → 708), so `competitions()`' database_id maps them to
the league-row id space. Each post-import league title has exactly one
first-place row → its list = the club's. GT: 63 clubs pinned, 0 conflicts, 0
lists claimed twice, 0 uid-order inversions, 18/18 agreement with the
live-table resolver; St Albans → 351 from three titles (2025, 2026, 2029).
Including imported (byte+13 = 0) title rows breaks it (11 inversions, 8
conflicts: imported tables repeat), hence the `imported` flag. The
live-table resolver (llp ↔ last season's row in the club's largest live
table, season chosen per comp by uid-order consistency) gets 38/39 diff
anchors — not integrated (misses promoted clubs; Brazilian state + national
leagues make llp ambiguous). The honours docstring claim "competition id
joins to the stage id space" was wrong; corrected.

**Next steps (after checkpoint 6):** (1) validate St Albans' chain against
the k-world yearly reports; (2) optional (DONE in checkpoint 7, via fixtures
+ uid order): pin untitled clubs (other
`tc_*_ls` sections share the grammar, but the cup ls is per TEAM, ordered by
first row, and its rows carry opponent team ids, not their own club — see the
re-framed cup section); (3) D2 award names, D3
competition names.

### League-history lists → clubs at scale (checkpoint 7, 2026-10-10; scans `tmp_leagues/e/e1–e31`)

**Integrated:** `Save.league_history_clubs()` → `Table[LeagueHistoryClub]`
(`history_index`, `club_uid`, `club_name`, `method`, `team_id`), new
`Save.league_history_table(season_year, competition_id)` (one past table, by
position, rows named), and `club_league_history(uid)` now uses the new pins.
`LeagueHistorySeason` gained `club_uid` / `club_name` / `club_method` (None from
`career_league_history()`, which stays club-free and fast). Readers:
`league_history_fixture_pins`, `resolve_league_history_clubs`.

**Methods (strongest first):**
1. **Fixtures — the big win.** `fixtures()` holds 2035/36 (second half only),
   all of 2036/37 and the current 2037/38. A team's league fixtures summed to
   (P, W, D, L, GF, GA) per (season start, competition) — and per stage, so
   tables whose row excludes play-offs (VNS/National/L2… play-off stages) or a
   later phase still match — equal exactly one non-imported history row of that
   competition in start year or start+1 (calendar leagues store the start year,
   e.g. comp 136: fixtures `season_start_year` 2036 ↔ row season 2036). Fixture
   competition ids are the league-row ids (7 = PL …). Uniqueness enforced on
   both sides at every level (an early stage-only version pinned list 15395 to
   two teams with a P9 record in different stages — fixed by keying uniqueness
   on (season, comp, record) across levels). **2,077 lists**, 0 conflicts.
2. **Titles** (checkpoint 6) add nothing new here: 63 title pins, of which **8
   name an honour club id that is not a `clubs()` uid** — 321/878 honour rows
   carry such ids (e.g. AFC Wimbledon's titles under 5110769 while its uid is
   5110756; Ebbsfleet 5100157 vs 5100154; Forest Green 109206 vs 109193). Those
   7–8 checkpoint-6 pins were therefore "clubs" no reader knows; fixtures pin the
   same lists to the real clubs. The remaining **55 agree 55/55**. Titles stay
   as a tier (other saves) but only for ids `clubs()` holds. (Open: what the
   honours id space is — it is not `Club.unique_id` either.)
3. **Uid-order fill (714 lists).** Between consecutive pinned lists i < j
   (clubs a < b), if the unpinned clubs with uid in (a, b) number exactly
   j − i − 1, assign in order. **Caveat found:** `clubs()` does not list every
   club — first-team ids run 52…44,884 for 33,001 clubs with 5,305 gaps, and
   first-team id order = uid order (0 inversions); e.g. Serie B list 607 plays
   as team 940 (between Chieti 939/uid 1121 and Como 941/uid 1123) but no club
   with uid 1122 is read, which made the only g > n "violation" (lists
   605–608). So a fill is allowed only when the two anchors' first-team ids
   leave no unused id between them (300 of 550 count-forced gaps; 714 of 3,988
   lists). Fills limited to lists below the last list holding an imported row
   (19,276): lists 19,276–19,295 have no imported rows and *do* break uid order
   (all 5 inversions among pinned lists are at ≥ 19,257/19,276 — Brazilian
   state-league clubs). Validation: 962/962 held-out fixture pins reproduced
   (5 random thirds), 198/198 fills with post-import rows match the competition's
   nation (comp → nation unanimous over fixture pins, 170/170 comps).

**Validation (GT):** 2,791 lists, 0 clubs with two lists, 0 uid inversions below
19,276, 55/55 title agreement, St Albans = 351 (fixtures, team 603), its 65 rows.
Coverage of non-imported rows by season: 2024 76.6% · 2025 77.4% · 2026 78.3% ·
2027 77.9% · 2028–2031 78.5–79.1% · 2032 79.2% · 2033 79.4% · 2034 80.1% · 2035
80.4% · 2036 81.8% · 2037 84.3%. English tiers (708/707/150/10/9/8/7): 90.2%
(2024) → 93–95% (2027–2035) → 96.3% (2036) → **100% (2037)**. Timing: ~41 s
(dominated by `fixtures()` 32 s); `club_league_history` afterwards 0.02 s.

**Demo — 2024/25 National League South (`league_history_table(2025, 708)`):**
St Albans 111, Worthing 96, Barnet 95, Bath 84, Chelmsford 83, Dulwich 78,
Maidstone 78, Dorking 77, Torquay 71, Hampton & Richmond 70, Weston-super-Mare 62,
Tonbridge 59, Aveley 59, Welling 55, **?** 55, **?** 54, Hornchurch 50, **?** 49,
Dover 49, Chippenham 47, Chesham 45, **?** 41, **?** 31, **?** 30 — 18/24 named. The
six unnamed lists (14365, 6987, 2360, 5193, 17721, 10421) end in VNS/VNN by 2032–
2034: relegated below the lowest level the save keeps tables for, so no fixture
evidence exists, and their gaps are not count-forced. **2036/37 Premier League
(`(2037, 7)`): 20/20 named** (Man City 82 … St Albans 11th 45 … Everton 9 pts).

**Dead ends / evaluated leads (do not redo):**
- **Best-eleven → league link.** Best-eleven lists (2,724) are a different
  membership and **not uid-ordered** (799 inversions once pinned). Best-eleven
  list → club *does* work: a table's 18 players' clubs during the season
  (move log `transfer_man_player_seasons`, team before/inside a Jan(S)–Jun(S+1)
  window, current club for players with no move) agree on exactly one club in
  12,955 of 26,434 tables → **2,396 lists, 0 cross-season conflicts, St Albans
  685 → 716** (6 clubs claimed by two lists) — worth integrating for the
  best-eleven open item. But linking to league lists needs (T,kind) → competition,
  and **(T,kind) is a level class shared across nations**, not a league id
  ((2,4) = VNS and VNN; (0,8) = L2 and comp 250 …; only 22/65 families map to one
  competition). Signature matching (family comp sets + uid bounds + nation)
  gives +225 lists but held-out 185 ok / **1 wrong** (best-eleven 2702 =
  Ljungskile: family (0,10) mixes calendar and split-year leagues, so its season
  offset is wrong for Swedish comps; P=255 view-only rows) → **not integrated**.
- Stage-level-only matches without cross-level uniqueness (see method 1).
- Live `league_tables()` for the unnamed view-only leagues: those competitions
  (4138, 5826, 2969, 6401–6405, 39–44, 711, 1066/1067 …) have **no live tables
  and no fixtures**; their history rows are mostly P=255 position-only rows.

**Next steps:**
1. Integrate best-eleven list → club (move-log unanimity) as
   `career_best_eleven` club identity; then retry the league link with a
   per-competition season offset (from fixture dates) and ≥ 3 best-eleven
   seasons, accepting only with 0 held-out errors.
2. Find which club ids the honours use (321/878 rows) — would revive titles as
   an independent tier.
3. Read the clubs `clubs()` misses (first-team-id gaps): each one found turns
   unsafe gaps into count-forced fills.

### League-history lists → clubs: player-history signatures (checkpoint 8, 2026-10-11; scratch `fm26-career/tmp_clubsig/c1–c6`)

**Integrated:** `LeagueHistoryClubMethod.PLAYER_HISTORY`,
`readers/player_stats_history.team_season_competitions` (4.7 s incl. decompress),
`readers/career_history.league_history_signature_pins`, wired as the last step of
`resolve_league_history_clubs` (`team_competitions` argument; `Save` passes it).

**Idea:** player_stats_hist_dt +5 is the team's league competition that season, on
every row (free rows included): 40,459 team-seasons, never two competitions for one.
Same id space as league-history rows; list season = player season + 1 except
calendar-year leagues (0). So every first team has a league signature, including
clubs relegated below the levels with fixtures — exactly the gap of checkpoint 7.

**Pitfalls found (all handled):** offsets learned by vote are meaningless for leagues
whose clubs never move (both offsets fit) → choose by purity, ties take the nation's
offset (club nation_id majority per competition); split leagues (Belgium list 7047/
7048 vs player 1077) → per-competition alias set (≥10% share, ≥2 obs); missing player
data ≠ contradiction; thin candidates (Pombal, 3 seasons) beat strong ones with a
single contradiction (Anadia 12/1) → reject when any other bracket club agrees on as
many seasons; same-round claims can invert uid order (PSM Makassar/PSMS Medan, Loures/
Pinhalnovense) → drop both sides.

**Validation:** without the uid bracket recall is poor (signatures collide); with it,
5-fold held out (a fifth of anchors removed): 958 right, **0 wrong** at ≥2 agreeing
seasons. Relaxing the rival rule to "rival has ≤1 contradiction" gives a wrong pin
(Persegres/PSBI) — keep strict. Real run: 534 new pins in 4 rounds, 0 inversions,
integrated output identical to research.

**Result:** 2024/25 VNS 24/24 named (Salisbury 55, Truro 54, Braintree 49, Taunton 41,
Merthyr 31, Farnborough 30). English tiers 98–100% every season (was 90–96%); all
leagues 91–99% (was 87–98%).

**Open:** a second count-forced uid fill after the signature pins (new anchors make
more gaps exact) — not tried; lists ≥ 19,276 (not uid-ordered) still need another
rule.

### transfer_man (`tad.`) — structure 80% mapped (checkpoint 1, 2026-10-09)

Section: 53,306,010 B, 13-byte header `03 01 'tad.' 23 00 | u32@8 = 11,560,192`

**73-byte season record** (1,433,706 rows total; chronology per year field:

Per-season rows for a club form a contiguous table sorted by seq (seq 07→3d
etc. within a season). The whole-squad table snapshot pattern (X constant
12,981 over ~21 consecutive club-716 rows) shows P6=£/small counter,
P7=counter. **P1 id space**: `Club.uid` space confirmed as candidate (St.
Albans City uid 716/unique_id 717; `P1>>8==716` = 972 rows; `Club.uid=716`
verified via fmsave clubs()). Family-A idB (`+25`, id<<8|seq) is a different
space (Dumas = 0x12c305) — likely transfer-negotiation ids, NOT person uids;
**player save uids (Dumas 2,000,205,315, Y-T 2,002,095,850) never appear in
transfer_man at all** (0 hits for u32 of any player uid/unique_id).

**Checkpoint 2 (2026-10-09): compact families decoded; FEE located.**

1. **`(club<<8|seq)` is a club-internal 16-bit object handle (0–255 slot)**
   used consistently by *all* record families: 73B rows (P1), family-A (+3),
   and all three compact families. For club 716 the handle space = squad/
   staff slot numbers (e.g. Dumas's 73B rows all carry handle `0x2cc07` =
   `(716, 7)`). seq is NOT season-relative — the same handle recurs across
   season tables for the same player.
2. **`11 00`-family — per-handle wage/contract ledger, 31,520 records**
   (0x500000–0x1080000, offsets: club-716 records monotonic ⇒ one global
   chronological log): `11 00 | u32 handle | u8 f | u64 V1 | u64 V2 | 00 |
   u32 t4` (28 B). f = 4 (66%) / 7 (23%) / 5 (10%) / rare others;
   t4 ≈ 0. **V1 = money (weekly-wage scale), V2 = V1 × n with n an integer
   1–13** (44% n=1, n=2/n=3 common, ≥6 rare; a few non-integer outliers =
   phase/variant cases to re-verify). Working hypothesis: n = contract
   portion (months-remaining/12 or term). Wage histories reconstruct per
   handle: e.g. Y-T 18,700 → 20,020 → 32,500. Two clubs (2536, 716) carrying
   the *identical* (V1,V2) pair ⇒ shared/loan registrations appear twice.
   Wage-ledger values ~20–38k for club 716 = wage-scale (£k/wk), NOT fees.
3. **`03`-family — (club, slot)→person registry, stride 27, 82,782 records**:
   `03 | u32 handle | u32 person | 02 | u32 A | u32 B (ff = null) | u32 C |
   u32 D`. Persons in the 0x07f1–0x07f5 xxxxx space (same space as family-A
   +56/+60 person slots); 6,306 distinct persons, one person recurs up to
   677× ⇒ each record = one (person, club-slot) association, ~13 per person
   (≈ seasonal spells). A often 0/small, B mostly −1, C flag-ish (1/8/16/
   1,024/16,384...). Same (handle, person) recurs with varied A = updates.
   Semantics (staff vs player slots) unresolved.
4. **`0b 00`-family — negotiation/offer records (variable length; 69 B
   stride in its uniform cluster @0x92f9xx)**: `0b 00 | 01 00 | u32
   negotiation-id | u32 ...` then money/clause u32s, ff-nulls, f32 −1.0
   sentinels, dates. **THE FEE column lives here**: u32 23,000 = Dumas's
   £23M *exactly* (11 records in the 0x92f9xx cluster = one negotiation's
   snapshots); ref space ≈ 0–2,281 distinct negotiation ids.
   (Caveat: the naive "u32@+8 = fee" parse fails globally — +8 is flags in
   other layouts; layout is tagged/variable, needs TLV-style walking.)
5. **73B P2/P3/P4 reinterpreted (wage-like, not fee)**. Club-716 P2==P4 rows:
   506 rows summing 5.9M — far from GT 127 buys/£101M ⇒ P2-set ≠ buy rows.
   Per-year P2 sums (~150–600k/yr) = wage-bill scale. New fee+add-ons model
   (unconfirmed): Dumas 23,972 = fee 23,000 + add-ons 972; Y-T 32,604 =
   32,500 + 104 with P9 = 104,680 ≈ the add-on in different units; UI
   displays the base fee. Family-A record for (716,7) @`0x0037e074`:
   V1 = 11,704 ≈ the 2035-row P6 (11,714) — another wage-ish quantity;
   V2 = V1<<8 confirmed.
6. Dumas 73B row trio: @`0x1395264` (P6=11,714), @`0x17ac8e8` (P2=P4=23,972),
   @`0x210d85c` (P3=P4=23,972, P6=543) — handle (716,7) recurs across the
   three zone-2 season tables.

**Open (next session, in order):**
1. TLV-parse the `0b 00`-negotiation family (length prefix observed:
   u32 24 immediately before some `0b 00` starts; ref 912 record shows
   evolving money 23,812 → 24,771 = raised bids). Build (negotiation-id →
   fee, clubs, date) and join to 73B rows via handles/recid. Validate vs
   GT: 127 bought / £101M / 39 sold (Σ fees with fee > 0).
2. `03`-family D-field meaning; is it the (player, wage-history) anchor
   family-A +56/+60 ids resolve into?
3. `11 00`-family: confirm V1 = weekly wage, n = contract months/12
   (compare n against a known GT contract length if one exists in
   screenshots; none currently pinned).
4. Date/tick fields: 73B X, family-A V1, `11 00` seq (day-of-season?)
   — anchor vs GT dates (joined 18/7/2023, Dumas 10/8/2036, Y-T 9/8/2036).
5. Then AGENTS.md integration checklist for the three compact families +
   73B reader.

### transfer_man checkpoint 3 (2026-10-09): family-A map final; 0b type-1 layout + units

Scripts `scan61–69` + inline tests. Corrections and additions to checkpoint 2:

**Family-A (definitive field map — supersedes the earlier "fee" read).**
`03 | 13 00 | u32 handle | u16 A1@+8 | u16 A3@+12 | u16 A4@+14 | u32 flags@+16 |
u32 recid@+21 | u32 idB@+25 | u8 tag@+29 | ff×4 @+30 | persons u32 @+56/+60/+64`.
- `+21` = **recid** (global append-log id, 0→45,156 monotonic); `+25` = idB
  (0x12b000–0x140000 ≈ 1.2M, the 73B-row id at write time); recid/idB
  increment +1 in lockstep down the append regions (verified 22,969→22,980 ↔
  idB 0x12c31a→0x12c325).
- The 23,000 @`0x17e2e2` and 32,500 @`0x2e8761` are **pure recid coincidences**
  — family-A carries NO fees. Checkpoint 2's "fee" anchor was wrong; the fee
  evidence is the 0b kind-8 money ladder (below).

**0b type-1 negotiation records (`0b 00 01 00` header, 56,808 sites in
0x100000–0x10d0000):**
```

                                  9: 973 · 4: 968 · 0: 179 · 2: 4)
+25 f32 −1.0 (mostly)   +29 u32 bitfield   then `ff 63` tag + u16 f63 + tail
```
Record length = **69 + k×14 extension blocks** (69: 39,588 / 83: 9,678 /
97: 1,135 / 125 / 153 / 209 / 349 … up to 5.7k B containers). Extensions hold:
28-B `11 00`-embeds, 18-B `06 00`-items, count-prefixed lists, and **nested
`0b 00 <subtype> 00` sub-records** (subtypes 0x0a/0x10/0x16/0x2c/0x32/0x40).

- money@+8 ladders per (ref, kind): ref-1479 = {6: 13,416; 7: 22,042 (×28);
  **8: 23,000 (×11)**; 9: 23,959}; ref-912 = {6: 14,638; 7: 22,789 & 24,048;
  8: 23,780 (×11, + 25,094 ×2); 9: 24,771}. Kind-7→8→9 sequence per ref looks
  like a **negotiation evolving across stages** (wage → bid → settled?).
  Kinds 3/4 = global constants (3: 4,446 ×1,027 recs; 4: 36,300 ×968) —
  template/defaults, not per-deal values.
- `ff 63` u16 (f63): per-record wage-offer value; common round values
  (20,020/20,680/…) recur across hundreds of refs/handles ⇒ **NOT
  player-unique**. f63 ≈ money+500 pattern common (e.g. 20,880→21,380).
- `06 00`-items (18 B): `06 00 | u32 handle | u32 value24 | 01 00 | 6c 07 |
  02/00 00 00`, value >>8 descending 39,000→242 inside one list = a **valuation
  / player-list** (hypothesis: squad valuation ranking).
- Nested-0b run @ref-1479 kind-6 container (`0f 00 00 00` prefix, six
  sub-records): shared ref 1,479, value const 99,890, per-record second value
  varies (23,816/703,533/…).

**Money units: no raw £ anywhere** (u32 23,000,000 / 32,500,000 / 101,000,000
= 0 sites in the section). GT fees £23M/£32.5M map to stored **23,000/32,500 =
£k** (fees in thousands); the wage-scale values (11-record V1/V2, 0b money
18.7k–40k, 73B P2–P4) are raw-£ weekly wages. The exact collisions (23,000 as
both Dumas fee and common wage) stay unresolved until fee-vs-wage kinds are
untagged; current best split: **kind-8 money = fee (£k), kind-7 = wage offer,
kind-6 = valuation-related, +25 f63 = wage offer**.

**Dual-club `11 00`-embed pairs inside one 0b record = transfer registration
pairs** (same (V1,V2) at two clubs; e.g. ref-195: (2535,86)+(716,33) V1 20,680
V2 62,040; ref-844: (716,2515) wage ×3). 1,040 records have dual pairs, but
**only 5 touch club 716** — not the main attribution channel for 166 GT
transfers. Embed-based ref→club attribution in general = NOISE (zone 1 holds
several interleaved append streams; `11 00`-runs are physically interleaved,
so in-span "other club" attribution is untrustworthy; only exact
same-(V1,V2) two-club pairs are signal).

**Dead ends this arc (do not redo):** u32 length-prefix before `0b 00` starts;
+12 as subject-club handle (census shows 81 clubs, no 716) or as a date;
f63 as player-unique wage; embed-count club attribution; raw-£ money;
"family-A +21 = fee".

**Open (in order):**
1. `+12` semantics; ref→club/player attribution (test: does Dumas's
   negotiation = a ref ≠ 1,479 found via kind-6 `06 00`-lists, or via a
   (716,x)/(543,x) `+16` handle link?).
2. Confirm kind-8-money = fee: collect (ref, kind-8 money) for 716-links and
   check Σ ≈ 101,000 (£k) / count ≈ 127 / max 23,000.
3. Units cross-check: 23,048 cluster (@0x8550xx, ~12 sites) & ref-912 24,048 —
   "×048" fee-like second cluster?
4. `0f 00 00 00` nested-0b run semantics (99,890 const).
5. 03-family A/B/C/D semantics; `11 00` V2/V1 ratio = contract term?
6. Date anchors vs GT (Dumas 10/8/2036, Y-T 9/8/2036).
7. Then integration checklist (model/reader/`Save.` methods/tests).

### transfer_man checkpoint 4 (2026-10-09): fees are NOT in transfer_man; 73B P4 = wage

Follow-up scans 70–76 **correct checkpoint 2's "FEE located" claim**:

- **money@+8 of 0b records is wage-scale in every kind** (histogram across
  all 56,808: kinds 3/4/6/7/8/9 all span ~0.4k–41k, p50 ~20–24k; kinds 0/2
  are junk parses of other layouts with high-bitted values). There is NO
  fee-scaled population. kind-9 max 40,707 = the league's wage ceiling.
  Every (ref, kind-8) ladder holds **exactly 11 records at one constant
  money** (structural; same for kind-9's single record).
- Per-record kind ladder per ref = negotiation evolution: kind 6 (lowest,
  ~12.8k p50) → 7 (varied, ~23k, n≈10–25 per ref) → 8 (constant ×11) → 9
  (constant ×1, +~1k over kind 8). Interpretation (best current): wage
  demand drafts, agreed offer, settled wage.
- `+16` handles are NOT "the deal's club": each ref's records carry ~5+
  DIFFERENT clubs, one or two records each (57 refs touch club 716/717).
  Also found: **refs duplicated in identical-ladder groups** (38 pairs, one
  group of 4 — refs 566/575/738/37649) ⇒ a deal is recorded under multiple
  participant-side negotiation ids.
- **73B rows P2/P3/P4 = player money in raw £ (weekly-wage scale), NOT
  fees.** The 23,972/32,604 anchor rows (Dumas (716,7), Y-T (716,172)) are
  wage snapshots: 23,972/32,604 are COMMON values (155/186 rows across 64/74
  clubs — league-standard wage levels), and the "127 buys = 23,972 sites"
  coincidence is dead. Byte map re-verified on the correct region rows
  (P1=(716,7) at `0x006dc8e8`, P8=104,680 u32 at s+50; s+58..72 = all unset
  on club-716 rows; earlier "embedded 0b/6c07" bytes at those offsets were
  an off-by-0x10d0000 misread of zone 1 — scan75 fixed the offset mapping:
  pickle rows ≤2034 live in `gt_tail/full_stream.bin`, 2035–37 rows at
  `transfer_man.bin` offset +0x10d0000).
- Fee cross-check: u32 raw-£ 23,000,000 / 32,500,000 / 101,000,000 = 0 hits;
  f32 same = 0 hits. 23,000 in transfer_man = only the ref-1479 kind-8
  ladder (wage offer 23,000 ≈ Dumas's wage 23,972); 32,500 ×24 sites =
  wage offers (Y-T's ladder ends at 32,500 = his 73B wage 32,604 minus
  104). **GT's £23M/£32.5M transfer fees do not appear anywhere in
  transfer_man** — transfer_man is the wage/contract ledger, not the
  transfer-fee log. Fee hunt should move to the club-history sections
  (`non_pl_hist_dt` is the next candidate: it holds `6c 07`-tagged item
  streams with year-pair u16 fields (0x07d5=2005 … 0x07e7=2023) and two
  u32 101,000 sites — unrefuted £k-scale signatures).

**Open (carried from checkpoint 3, re-ordered):**
1. Ref→club/player attribution in 0b (kind-6 `06 00`-list handles; deal
   threading across duplicate refs).
2. Fee column: decode `non_pl_hist_dt` item grammar / club history sections;
   validate Σ ≈ 101,000 (£k) over 127 buys.
3. 73B P6/P7/P8/P9 semantics (P8/P9 = wage × weeks?).
4. 03-family A/B/C/D; `11 00` V2/V1 ratios.
5. Date anchors. 6. Integration checklist for the 73B-row reader (layout is
   proven; P-field semantics unconfirmed — integrate with all-unconfirmed
   statuses like `LeagueHistorySeason`).

### Fee-hunt elimination arc (checkpoint 5, 2026-10-09): value anchoring closed, no per-transfer fee log

Scripts `scan78–98`. Goal: locate the per-transfer fee store using GT anchors
(Dumas buy £23M 10/8/2036 = 23,000 £k; Y-T sale £32.5M = 32,500; club spend
Σ£101M = 101,000). **Result: the fee values are not recoverable by value
anchoring in ANY section — the exact-value collisions everywhere are
coincidences with per-club record constants (attendance/capacity) and wage
values.** A structurally-decoded transfer/fee section remains the only viable
path; candidates left: `person_db_changes` (21 MB, unprobed),
`non_pl_hist_dt` item grammar, club-finance monthly records
(`person_record_history_dt` probed and parked — checkpoints 7–9: grammar +
person refs pinned, no fee store).

1. **`tc_record_man` 23,000/32,500 sites = attendance records** (7 of 9): shape
   `01 ff 01 | u32 | 01 <u8> | <u8> <u16 year>` with years 0x079b=1947 …
   0x07f5=2037. These are "record attendance" rows per club-season. Dead.
2. **Corrections.** The claimed "32,495,604 in non_pl_hist_dt" (checkpoint 4
   narrative) is WRONG — exact byte-find: 0 hits in every section (scan79/81).
   The `u32 101,000` sites in non_pl_hist_dt (2) are inside generic u32-soup;
   unaligned reads over dense u16 pair streams fabricate 0x02/0x08-tagged junk
   families (scan79b numpy sweep: every section dominated by 0x02000000-band
   junk) — **pure value anchoring is closed as a method**; only structural
   decode (find records first, then read their fields) can pin fees.
3. **`manager_manager` (5.8 MB, `tad.` v23) is NOT a transfer_man copy** (no
   73B grid, 0 zstd, few 73B markers): u32 id chains 450k–830k (likely manager/
   staff ids), compact-family-count-like bytes (`11 00`=5,034, `0b 00 01 00`=
   275, `03 00`=29,730) coincidental. Karl's (182,2023) spell date pair = 0
   hits. Uniform record motif `34 21 00 00 | 02 | … | u32 V | xx00 | yy00 |
   <u32 V2> | 02 80 04 00 00 02` with big companions (565k–709k) — semantics
   unknown. Not a fee store.
4. **`tc_extended_club_records_history_dt` (30.3 MB, `tmc.` v5) — ruled out as
   the fee log** (scan96/97/98): dense per-entity TLV id-stream sharing the
   tc_record_man record family (`4f 02`=591, `b9 05`=1,465 consts). u32 23,000
   ×14 and 32,500 ×22 both sit at an exact 0x350 (848 B) stride inside two
   tight blocks — per-season REPEATING constants in adjacent per-club/season
   records, stamped year words 0x07e7=2023/0x07e8=2024 (not 2036) — capacity/
   attendance-like per-season values, not the 2036 fee. u32 716 ×242 / 717
   ×1,526 (u16 716/717 ×1,132/2,196) but club uid 23,292,170 ×0. u32 101,000
   ×6 sites = recurring key 31,445 + companions 101,124/104,005, no 716/717
   link. Coincidence family, closed.
5. **`tc_history_dt` compact money rows (scan95)**: 1,662 rows of
   `1d 1a <u16 yr> 2c | u32 money | ff ff ff ff | u32 ≤4 | 0000 0000` — years
   2024: 1,263 / 2029: 215 / 2035: 184; values 8.7k–795k = per-club per-season
   aggregates (wage/finance scale), not fees (2035 block consecutive at 21 B
   stride 0x28aa20–0x28b182).
6. **`person_record_history_dt` / club-record screens note**: the UI's "record
   signing £23M / record sale £32.5M" may be computed from per-transfer
   records rather than stored as a separate record; per-transfer records
   themselves (dates + fees) remain unfound and are plausibly inside
   `person_record_history_dt` (a 131 MB per-person record store).
7. Person/club id space map (validated this arc): person save uids NEVER
   appear as u32 in any history/transfer section (Dumas 2,000,205,315, Y-T
   2,002,095,850 = 0 hits everywhere) — history sections key persons by their
   own small id spaces (e.g. hall_of_fame person uid 9,330,425 with plain-text
   names, 03-family person ids 0x07f1xxxx–0x07f5xxxx which are actually
   (X-tick,year) date packs). Club uid 23,292,170 appears in: award_year_hist
   (75), pl_hist (52, often as adjacent pairs), non_pl_hist (47), hall_of_fame
   (8).

**Revised fee-hunt open items:** person_record_history_dt structural decode
first (records with (X,year) date words + money fields keyed by person ids);
then club-finance monthly records (`finance_manager` is tiny (2,954 B) — the
monthly balances behind GT's -£1.2M→£131M arc live somewhere; "finances" is
not a section name — check `starting_club_debt_db`/game_db streams). Validate
against GT only after a reader exists.

### transfer_man checkpoint 6 (2026-10-09): 73B grid reader INTEGRATED

`Save.transfer_man_player_seasons()` → `Table[PlayerSeasonRecord]`
(`src/fmsave/models/transfer_history.py`, `src/fmsave/readers/transfer_history.py`,
wired in `_save.py` with cache key `table:transfer_man_season_records`; tests
`tests/test_transfer_history.py` — synthetic blobs, no save data in the repo).

Decoder design (proven on GT, scan100–scan109):

- **Framing**: clear season region = section header .. first zstd magic; then
  13 concatenated zstd frames (seasons 2022..2034, oldest first; clear region
  = newest 2035–2037). Frame boundaries are magic positions; a false magic
  inside one frame's compressed bytes ends a segment early, so a segment that
  fails to decompress is retried extended over the next magic. A frame that
  decompresses under none of a 0–8 trailing-byte drop sweep is skipped (final
  frame needs drop=1 — the 1-byte section tail; the others need 0).
- **Row read**: single `re.finditer` pass anchored on head word
  `00 [00|01] [00|01] 07` (NOT `[01]` — that regex character class matches the
  ASCII bytes, a bug that cost a session round; `[\x00\x01]` is required), then
  per-candidate validation: separator bytes at row offset +8/+13/+18 == 0, and
  season year ∈ 2005–2050 ∪ {1900}. Year 0xffff is REJECTED: on GT every
  ff-year candidate is one uniform junk family (club 0, slot 0/11/76, type 1,
  flags 0x01ff, tick 65280, value fields prefixed 0x0192/0x076c) — 89 hits in
  zone1 + 9 in zone2; accepting the sentinel admitted 98 junk rows per save.
- **Row type 33 wildcard**: all 1,320 t33 rows carry head id 0xffffff
  (club 16777215, slot 255) — club-free world-level money rows (£1k–£193k/wk
  in value_b). No club-uid gate in the reader: any u32 head id is accepted
  (a u24 field by construction); the year/separator fingerprint does the
  filtering.
- **Zone2 is not a pure butted grid**: row runs butt at stride 73 (~277,760
  clear-region rows) but ~238 ~1.1 KB story/TLV chunks (names, club strings,
  base64) interrupt them — hence per-row fingerprint validation over a
  store-wide grid walk (scan105; a grid-walk validator dies on the chunks).
- **Header is 12 bytes**, not 13: `03 01 'tad.' <u16 0x23> <u32 0xb06500>` —
  the u32 sits at offset 8 and the section content starts at 12.

### transfer_man checkpoint 7 (2026-10-10): wage-ledger reader INTEGRATED

`Save.transfer_man_wage_ledger()` → `Table[WageLedgerRecord]` (same model/
reader modules as the 73B grid, cache key
`table:transfer_man_wage_ledger`, tests in `tests/test_transfer_history.py`).

Scans `wl_verify.py..wl_verify5.py` re-derived the layout before writing:
checkpoint 2's `u64 V1 | u64 V2` reading is **equivalent but not exact** —
the record is `11 00 | u32 handle | u8 kind | u32 V1 | u32 0 | u32 V2 | u32 0
| u8 flags | u32 tail_flags` (28 B); reading the values as u64s only worked
because the pads are zero. Corrections to checkpoint 2:

- **V2 = V1 × n does NOT hold generally**: integer ratios cover only ~36%
  (n=1: 5,492 / n=3: 4,142 / n=2: 1,707). But **flags ≠ 0 (788 records,
  flags ∈ {2,3,4,5,6,7}) ⇔ V2 = V1 × 5 exactly** — the flag switches a ×5
  money-unit form. flags=0 records are the mixed-ratio population.
- kinds in the ledger band: 4 (66%), 7, 5, 2, 3, 8, 17 (+ a junk family
  `kind 0, value 0/8` mostly outside the band). The rare-kind set extends
  checkpoint 2's (3..10): kind 2 (232), 17 (14) are real.
- **The zone-1 stream is one chronological log**: every gap between
  consecutive ledger records is a multiple of 69 — the 28-B wage records and
  the 69-B negotiation records butt each other. 28-B records also sit
  embedded inside negotiation-record bodies (811 outside the ledger band);
  the reader cannot tell embeds from standalone ones and reads both.
- A tagged interleave family (first money word's bytes 1–2 = `01 02`) is
  rejected explicitly in `_wage_record`; kind/zero-pad/value bounds and the
  club-high-byte < 0x10 check are the rest of the fingerprint.

GT: **32,235 records, 2,011 clubs; club 716: 28 records**, led by the
dual-club pair (716 slot 0x21 / 2536 slot 86) both 20,680/62,040 (the
registration-pair anchor). value_a 0–301,424 p50 22,440; value_b 0–332,640.
Dumas (716,7) and Y-T (716,172) have **0 wage-ledger records** — the ledger
does not cover every player; nothing is lost vs checkpoint 2 (those "wage
histories" used other slots).

Still open in zone1 (unchanged): 0b negotiation TLV walking + ref→club/player
attribution, family-A `03` integration (its `person` id space was later
reinterpreted as (X-tick, year) date packs — DO NOT integrate as a person
registry without re-checking), date anchors.

GT validation: 1,428,558 rows, year histogram 2022:39, 2023:32,213,
2024:124,931, 2025:109,561, 2026:93,730, 2027:94,208, 2028:102,511,
2029:103,068, 2030:99,120, 2031:98,263, 2032:98,407, 2033:97,736, 2034:97,100,
2035:96,093, 2036:95,968, 2037:85,610 (matches the checkpoint-1 pickle counts
exactly); 3,225 distinct clubs (max uid 3,675); Dumas row and companion
reproduce; junk rows 0. Decode ~13.4 s, cached per Save instance.

Not integrated yet: zone1's compact families (family-A registrations, 11 00
wage ledger, 03, 0b negotiation — maps in checkpoints 1/3), and per-transfer
fees remain unfound (next: `person_record_history_dt`, 131 MB).

### transfer_man checkpoint 8 (2026-10-10): the 73B grid is a per-person MOVE log; rows named (scans `tmp_transfer/r1–r12`)

**The "(club uid << 8 | squad slot) handle" reading of checkpoints 1–7 was
wrong.** The 32-bit word is the person's **history reference** (`pindex + 1`,
`Save.history_player_references()`), in every family that carries it:

| family | field | resolves to a player | random ids, same range |
|---|---|---|---|
| 73B grid | head id (row +4) | 47–80% per row type (t1 58%, t14 80%); t6/t9 0% (staff) | 23.9% |
| `11 00` wage ledger | handle (+2) | 93.3% | 23.7% |
| `0b 00 01 00` negotiation | `+16` | 99.7% (51,237 non-null) | 23.7% |
| `03` family (27 B) | u32 after the `03` | 84.0% (108,489) | 23.7% |

The test refs (Dumas 189608, Y-T 280836, Tshongo 458697, Gumbs 493490, Hodges
537474) sit in transfer_man at: 73B grid heads (Dumas `0x1c90d40`, Y-T
`0x2348877`, Tshongo `0x19f303f`, Hodges `0x14b6847` + compressed seasons),
`03` records (`03 | ref | u16 day | u16 year | 60/02 | …`, the "person" u32 of
checkpoint 2 = a game date, year 0x07f2–0x07f5), and `0b` records' `+16`
(neg-ref 603 holds Dumas, Tshongo, Gumbs and Hodges — 603 is St Albans' team
id, see below; the `0b +4` "negotiation ref" may be a team id too — unchecked).

**73B row semantics (re-derived; layout unchanged):**
- `value_a` = destination **team id** (`Team.team_id`, via `clubs().teams`),
  `value_b` = origin team id, `value_c` = destination on transfers/loans, the
  origin on moves to no club. **St Albans City's first team = 603** (team ids
  ≠ club uids: 603 is Aston Villa's *club* uid, which made the old reads look
  like noise). They are not money: the "23,972 / 32,604 wage anchors" were rows
  of other people (head 0x2cc07 = reference 183,303, not Dumas).
- `tick` + `season_year` (row +36) = one 4-byte game date in fmsave's
  `decode_date` packing (day-of-year low 9 bits, intra-day slot above): all
  1,428,558 GT rows decode. Dumas's row = **10/8/2036** (GT 10/8/2036 ✓),
  Y-T's sale = **9/8/2037** (GT says "9/8/2036?" — the year was uncertain; the
  save says 2037).
- `value_f` / `value_g` = history reference of the destination / origin club's
  manager at the time (328,408 = Karl Hudgell, via
  `history_person_reference(2002143422)`, on every St Albans-side row).
- `record_type` = move kind, calibrated on St Albans: 1 transfer, 3 loan, 4
  free move (to/from no club or between clubs), 5 signing seen only at the
  human's club (42 rows game-wide, all St Albans), 7 trial (days before a t4
  signing, or 4 April academy trialists), 14 youth intake (no origin; 16/yr),
  24 release to no club (mostly intake players at 30 June), 37 retirement,
  6/9 staff appointment/departure (0% player refs).

**Integrated:** `PlayerSeasonRecord.club_uid/slot` → `player_reference`, new
`date`; `WageLedgerRecord.club_uid/slot` → `player_reference`; new
`ClubPlayerMove` + `Save.club_player_moves(club_uid)` (rows on any of the
club's own teams, joined to player uid/name and both clubs). Tests synthetic.

**GT validation (`club_player_moves(716)`, 1,087 moves, 683 named; all dated
≥ 18/7/2023):**
- **Bought: t1 in 31 + t4 in 54 + t5 in 42 = 127 = GT "127 players bought"
  exactly.**
- Sold / released do NOT reproduce by type alone: t1 out 25 (+21 t4 moves to
  another club = 46) vs GT 39; t24 out 60 (50 naming a current player) and t4
  to-no-club 79 vs GT 50 released. Loans: 182 out, 5 in.
- 2036 summer window named in full, e.g. 23/6 Marvin Tshongo (Guingamp → SA,
  t1), 5/8 Eneko Garrido (Hibernian), 8/8 Gerardo Real (Monterrey), 10/8
  Corentin Dumas (Saint-Etienne), out: 16/6 Peter Fennell (→ Luton), 5/7 Jasper
  Torkildsen (→ Bournemouth), 18/8 Charlie Thomas (→ Hull), 30/6 five t4
  releases, nine loans out.
- Grid history covers players back to 2023 (Y-T: Cardiff → SA 3/8/2034, t1);
  37% of St Albans moves name a reference no longer in `players()` (retired
  players, staff).

**Open (next):**
1. The out-side split vs GT 39 sold / 50 released (which types/flags the
   manager profile counts; `flags` 1 vs 257 and head variants are unexplored).
2. `value_e`, `count` (loans: high u16 4–11 over 0xffff — loan months?),
   `value_d` (loan rows), head variant bytes.
3. Re-read the `0b` negotiation `+4` "ref" and `+12` as team ids / dates, and
   the `03` family as (person, date, …) — both now have a person key.
4. Retired players' names (37% unresolved at St Albans) — same open item as the
   best-eleven checkpoint.
5. Checkpoints 1–7 statements built on the handle reading (club 716 "squad
   tables", "Dumas (716,7)", dual-club wage pairs) are superseded by this one.

### person_record_history_dt — first survey (checkpoint 7, 2026-10-09; scans 110–118)

The next fee-log candidate structurally (131,338,838 B dt + 13,656,218 B ls,
both extracted). First-pass facts:

- **Header 12 B**: `03 01 'tmc.' 02 00 | b6 00 | e7 07` — the `tmc.` family
  (same tag as tc_manager_history_dt which uses `03 01 'tmc.' 02 00 <u32
  count> <u16>`), but here a u16 2023 word sits in the header (import/season
  mark) and no count u32 at that position.
- **ls** (`03 01 'tad.' 04 00 | u32 7,880` + 3,414,051 u32): NOT a sorted
  offset array — 1.76M descents; 2,192,338 entries land inside dt. In-range
  consecutive pairs sit 39–42 B apart. Hypothesis: per-person pointer lists
  (7,880 = a table-count field of some other layer). The >dt-range entries
  (1.22M) are a second value space — unexplained.
- **dt records**: 1,839,096 occurrences of separator `ff ff ff ff ff ff 00`;
  distances between separators are all multiples of 21 (42 dominant with 12,656
  hits in the first sample, then 84, 63, 21, 126, …) → a 21-byte atomic record
  unit; 42 B two-unit records dominate. Records carry:
  - a ref u32 (`ff ff ff ff` = none) after the separator,
  - a tick u16 + **year u16** — `c9 00 | e4 07 (2020)`, `de 60 | e9 07 (2025)`,
    `b6 00 | e7 07 (2023)` — and often a SECOND (tick, year) pair later in the
    record (contract from/till shape, unconfirmed),
  - **person uid literals**: u32 `0x77xxxxxx` — 10,158 aligned occurrences; one
    confirmed in a record body (`0x773b7628` at +20 of the record at dt[0x2a]),
    ~39.5k more unaligned (unaligned-sweep caution: some are noise),
  - money-like u32s: 645,833 / 505,193 / 605,228 in one record family —
    ≈ wage-annual scale (£/52 = £9.7k–12.4k/wk ✓ plausible per-season wage
    totals).
- **Year coverage**: u16 year words 2020–2037 present, counts rising
  2020:27k → 2037:336k (matchday-granularity whole-game accumulation, like
  tc_manager_history's append-only behaviour).
- **Person ids still half-open** (the key next arc): full uids for Dumas
  (0x7738b603) and YT (0x77558eea) have ZERO hits in dt; YT's low16
  (0x8eea = 36,586) hits 749 times in record-shaped contexts
  (`… <3d/7a/7b/6f> 00 00 | ea 8e 00 00 | <u32> | ff ff 00 …`), while Dumas's
  low16 (0xb603) hits 0, Dumas's low16±1 hit 5/111, and high16s hit
  (dumas 0x7738: 114; yt 0x7755: 179). Encodings differ per record family —
  records reach most persons via the **ls index**, with uid literals only in
  special records.
- **Fee-value dead end (extends checkpoint 5)**: 23,000,000 / 32,500,000 /
  101,000,000 (raw £) → 0 hits; 23,000 (£k) → 14 hits all in wage-shaped
  coincidences (checkpoint-5's pattern: (tick, year) records with ff-refs);
  32,500 → 3 hits, same shape. **The fee, if held here, must be reached
  structurally via a person-linked record — not by value.**

**Concrete next steps:** (1) segment the ls — map positions → ascending runs,
bind pointer → record offset, and count records per person; (2) pin the record
grammar from a clean run: diff the records 42 B apart at dt[0x2a..0x120],
confirm the 21-byte unit's field map, and read the `3d/7a/7b/6f/5e/21 00 00`
prefix as a family/type byte; (3) decode the YT family against the pinned
facts (sold 9/8/2036, £32.5M) — his 749-hit low16 family first; (4) resolve
Dumas through the ls index (not id literals) and dump every record in his
list; check one Aug-2036 record for a fee-shaped field.

### person_record_history_dt — record grammar progress (checkpoint 8, 2026-10-10; scans 119–122)

**ls structure** (scan119): maximal ascending runs = 1,650,811; sizes 2–3
dominate (1.14M runs of 2, 236k of 3, 231k of 1; largest 1,442). The ls mixes
dt pointers with out-of-range values (a second id space, unexplained) and
occasional small in-range values that point at non-record bytes — entries
where the target parses as a clean record are the person-pointer entries.

**Record skeleton pinned** (scans 120–122), byte map at the true head start
`h`:

- `[u32 refA] [u16 refB] [00] [u32 refC]` — an 11-byte head; all-ff
  (`ff ff ff ff ff ff | ff ff ff ff`) = no reference. NOT always sentinel:
  real refs appear (e.g. refA=0x43b7b seen in one record; the scan115 YT
  family carries real values in these positions).
- `[u16 tick] [u16 year]` at h+11/h+13 — tick ∈ day/season-tick range
  (1 = 1 Jan, 182/201 ≈ pre-season, 21–33k in-season), year 2020–2039 (2039+
  seen = likely far-future contract expiry sentinel, cf. transfer_man).
- `[u8 flag]` h+19 (01/02/05/08/15 seen), then ~19 zero bytes, then
  `[u16 c1]` h+39 (14/40/61/82/94/95/155/269/353 seen — small per-record
  counter, semantics open), `[u32 c2]` h+42 and beyond: sentinel
  `ffffffff` on most pointer-reached records; **the scan115 YT family has c2
  = person low16 and a following money u32** (645,833/505,193/605,228) — so
  the tail extends on non-sentinel records and carries money fields.

**Find-anchor alignment rule** (the reason fixed offsets drift): the head's
ff-run length varies with which ref fields are sentinel — the naive
`ff×6 00`-find lands 0 / +2 / +4 past the true head start depending on
whether refA or refB carry values. A robust parser must back-scan from the
`00` byte and test the three u32 candidate starts. (This is why scan122's
fixed +11/+13 fields read sane on some records and junk on others — the
underlying 42-B cycle with sentinel heads is real: 642k records of exactly
42 B, 236k of 84, 60k of 126 — 42-multiples dominate the 1.18M
sentinel-head population.)

**Person binding not yet made**: no ls run parsed yet had stable c2 (c2 is
sentinel ff on the all-clean records) — the person link must come either from
the non-sentinel-head records (refA/refB/refC holding club/person refs) or
from ls side structure (per-person list boundaries). YT's 749-low16-hit
family remains the best bridge: decode that family's records first.

**Dead ends this round:** the largest ls run's entries (0x2f0cb…, 4 apart)
point into non-record data — ls entries are NOT all record pointers; treat
head_ok-validated entries only, and never assume stride between ls entries
equals record stride.

**Next steps:** (1) robust head parser (back-scan from `00`, test u32
candidates at -11/-7/-4) to give every ls entry a canonical record start;
(2) re-run run-wise field dump with canonical starts — look for stable
c1/c2 per person and for money u32s in tails; (3) decode the YT low16 family
(`… c1 00 00 | <low16> | <money u32> …` records) and check for a 2036
record with an Aug tick matching his 9/8/2036 sale; (4) same for Dumas (in
10/8/2036, £23M) — if his fee appears here, the fee log is found and the
integration follows.

### person_record_history_dt — person refs pinned, fee hunt closed for this section (checkpoint 9, 2026-10-10; scans 123–129)

**Robust head parser built** (scan123, `/tmp_xfer/scan123.py`): anchor every
record on its (tick, year) pair — candidate heads = `dt[p+6]==0` with u16
year@p+13 in 2018–2045 and tick≤40,000 → **2,780,215 candidate heads**.
ls binding on the first 300k in-range ptrs: **ptr-to-head distance
dominantly 3** (ls entries point at head+3, not the head start), 235k/300k
binding within ≤12 B. 42-B stride between consecutive bound heads.

**Person reference = refC, u32 @h+7** (scans 125–126; the 125 result
`refC = person<<8` was an `<IHI` off-by-one — the third u32 read at +6, raw
bytes `ea 8e 00 00` at +7 decode directly):

- **Dumas = 0xb604** (low16 + 1; matches `player_scan`'s sound-header
  person_id+1 convention) → **12 records** (2023×2, 2027, 2029×2, 2031,
  2033×3, 2037×3 — *no 2036 record at all*: his 10/8/2036 IN-transfer does
  not surface in this parse of the section). Dumas variants ±1
  (0xb602/0xb603/0xb605) → 0 records.
- **Y-T = 0x8eea → 120 records** (2018–2037; year 2027+ dumped in
  scan126/127) plus **0x8ee9 → 2** and **0x8eeb → 1** — adjacent refs,
  0x8ee9 records share the exact tick of a 0x8eea neighbour (pair rows).
- **refB (u16@+4) = a second small-ref space**: 5249 / 5254 / 5284 / 5287
  seen on Y-T records, 65535 (null) on most; never a person-ref target
  value. Candidate = club/small-entity ref (semantics open).

**42-B frame field map final** (values at +42/+46/+50/+54 belong to the
NEXT record — earlier "+46 money" readings were next-record refA):

```
+0  u32 refA (0xffffffff = none; real values ≈ 76k–823k, NOT dt pointers —
    verified: no head exists at refA offsets)
+4  u16 refB          +6  pad 00      +7  u32 refC (person ref)
+11 u16 tick          +13 u16 year
+15 u32 f15 (0 or bitfield: 0x8000 family, 0x80000002, 0x40)
+19 u16 f19 — often the year echo (0x7eb=2027, 0x7f3=2035, 0x7f4=2036,
              0x7f5=2037); 0xffff sentinel on one sub-family (f15=0x40,
              f21=0xffffffff, f35=1)
+21 u32 f21 (0 / bitfield / 0xffffffff)
+27 u32 f27 (small counter: 0/1/12/16/44/50)
+31 u32 f31 (0 or ref-scale: 5262/3294/27901/59116 — club/second-ref scale?)
+35 u8  f35 (0x1e/0x20/0x21/0x24/0x3c/0x3d/0x3e/0x3f/0x41/0x47/0x6f/0x7a …)
+36 u16 f36 (0 seen)  +38 u32 f38 — tail value
```

f38: sometimes **echoes refC** (0x8eea on Y-T rows), sometimes a second
person-scale ref (0x12e3d = 77,629), sometimes a small value
(404/934/1481/1486/11963/20667), sometimes 23,000 (see below). Pairs of
records sharing one tick (42 B apart) are common (Dumas 12508×2, 32499×2;
Y-T 11473×2) — first-of-pair carries refA ref + small f38, second carries
ff refA + bigger f38.

**tick semantics OPEN** (blocked guesses, all refuted): not day-of-year,
not days-since-any-epoch (5814/5815 recur in 2024/2025/2026; tick=0 rows at
2018 AND 2022), not an ls index (scan128: ls[tick] binds no better than
base density). A tick≈6804–6810 family recurs across half the years holding
identical values — template/constant records (cf. tc_extended per-season
constants), suggesting ticks are family-relative counters. Year field
itself is solid (u16, 2020–2037 coverage rising toward 2037).

**Fee hunt closed for this section** (scans 126–129): raw-£
23,000,000/32,500,000/2,300,000/3,250,000 → **0 hits**. The £k-scale hits
are all coincidences: 23,000 ×14 = (a) f38=23,000 on ~10 tick≈6805
template records across unrelated years/seasons, (b) f19 AND f31 both
23,000 inside tick=11277/2034 records (wage-snapshot rows, cf. checkpoint
4's Y-T ladder analysis); 32,500 ×3 = wage-scale refA/context, not in any
person-bound transfer-shaped record. **No per-transfer fee record exists in
`person_record_history_dt` under the person anchors** — extends checkpoint
5's value-anchoring closure to this section's decoded structure.

**Dead ends this arc (do not redo):** refA as dt pointer; tick as
ls index / calendar day / epoch offset; "+46 money" field (was next record);
Dumas ±0/±1 ref variants; fee values by anchor (closed checkpoint 5).

**Concrete next steps (deprioritised — section parked):** family census by
(f15, f19, f35) signatures + per-family semantic labels; the 84/126-B
long-record families' tails; what produces a "second id space" in ls.
Fee hunt moves to `person_db_changes` (21 MB, unprobed) and
`non_pl_hist_dt` item grammar (checkpoint 4 pointer). **→ CLOSED, see
fee-hunt closure checkpoint below.**

### Fee hunt CLOSED (2026-10-10; scans 130–136): no per-transfer fee store exists in the save container

> **Superseded (2026-10-10, see "Transfer fees FOUND" below):** the fee of every move is
> stored per player in `player_stats_hist_dt` (row +7), on the rows of the club the player
> left. The hunt below missed it because it anchored on the shown, rounded values (23,000,
> £23M, 32.5M); the stored fees are exact (22,937,564, 32,347,260). The eliminations below
> still hold for the sections they name.

Every named candidate probed or structurally identified; none carries fees.

1. **`person_db_changes` (21 MB) = person attribute-change log, NOT fees**
   (scan130). Header `03 01 'tmc.' f1 0d | 3d 03 | 04 00 01 0a | 06 00 00
   00` then tagged entries embedding **reversed field-name strings**
   (`ecaP` = Pace, `srev` = vers, `yttd`, `inud`, `CApU`…). Fee anchors
   23,000/32,500/23M/32.5M/101,000 = 0 hits. Year words cluster 2020–2022.
2. **`interaction_manager` (6.8 MB)** — the manager's interaction log:
   dense tagged stream (`01 00 18`, `ff ff 7f`, `01 01` motifs; 325k u16
   2037 words). Fee anchors = 0 hits (u32 all five values). Fee not stored
   as raw £k/u32 here.
3. **News strings carry only name-pair tables and stadium names** — "the
   fee" narrative does not exist as text: `million` ×0, `Dumas` ×2 (other
   players: Hamza Dumas, Dumas Ribeiros), Corentin ×2 (Tielens, Gilson).
   News items embed per-item person name tables as
   `u32 len | name | u32 len | name`.
4. **News money skeleton** (`… 18 40 00 | 49 05 | ff ff ff ff | u32
   money`, scan136): only 36 sites — a rare news subtype (wage-scale
   1.2k–47k values), far too few to be global transfer news. Not the fee
   column.
5. **Family-A u16 sweep** (scan133/134 — the fee-£k-in-u16 blind spot,
   previously only searched as u32): all 31,789 family-A rows swept for
   u16 23,000/32,500 anywhere in the 145-B row → 39 rows with 32,500 (34
   at in-row +80 = the recurring league-standard wage, none club-716),
   1 × 23,000. 0 club-716 rows carry fee-scale u16s. Family-A carries NO
   fees in any width.
6. **Small sections**: contract_man / feeder_man / job_centre /
   board_takeover_manager / dispute / person_record_manager → 0 hits on
   all fee anchors.
7. **`non_pl_hist_dt` item grammar identified** (scan135 — a decoder
   candidate for staff histories, not fees): stream of 20-B items
   `01 00 6c 07 | u8 kind (01/02/10) | u8 sub (0b/1e/71/18/05/77/aa…) | 00
   00 | u32 id (258/602 … 930,613 = person/club id space) | u16 day1 | u16
   year1 | u16 day2 | u16 year2` — a spell record with from/to dates. ls
   (`03 01 'tad.' 04 00`, 643,778 u32s, ALL in dt range) points at item
   leaders; per-entity groups of ~3 items. Year words dense 2000–2023.
8. **`tc_history_dt` §1d 1a money rows** (checkpoint 5 item 5): per-club
   per-season aggregates — the only money-bearing rows left, and they are
   single (club, season) aggregates, not per-transfer values.

**Conclusion:** the per-transfer fee is not stored as its own value
anywhere in the sections probed (53 MB × transfer_man, 131 MB ×
person_record_history_dt, 21 MB × person_db_changes, 42.7+ MB × others,
news, manager/human sections). The UI's fee numbers must derive from (a)
the `0b` kind-8 wage ladders (refuted as wage-scale in checkpoint 4), (b)
73B P2/P4 fee+add-on composites (refuted, wage snapshots), or (c) data
outside the probed history sections. **The remaining honest option for the
site is fee-less transfer rows + the 73B P2/P4 money fields flagged
"money (wage-scale, unconfirmed)".** Dead ends to never redo: u32 AND u16
value anchoring in every section (this checkpoint + 4 + 5); fee narrative
strings in news; `03 13 00`-prefixed family-A row pattern (wrong — rows
are detected by `13 00` preceded by a kind byte 02–0b with ff×4 @+30).

### player_stats_hist_dt — head grammar pinned, per-player binding UNSOLVED (2026-10-10; scans ~p1–p13, tmp_xfer/s1–s14 + heredocs)

Extract: `/home/karl/fm26-career/tmp_pstats/player_stats_hist_dt.bin`
(876,453,136 B). Scripts `tmp_xfer/s1..s14.py` + one-off heredocs.

**What is solid.** After the 0x139-byte section head, records are a uniform
152-B grid: `on_grid(i) = (i - 0x139) % 152 == 0`. ~5.76M rows. Head (offsets
into the row):

| off | field | notes |
|-----|-------|-------|
| +0  | u32 key1 | club or team uid — **every** sampled value resolves via `club_index().club_by_uid` / `.team_to_club` (716=St. Albans City, 853=Istres, 866=OM, 36586=Sport Clube Tarouca, big uids like 91855 → team→club 47070350) |
| +4  | u16 key2 | competition id or 0xffff=null; resolves as `Competition` (5254/5284/5287/20/22/45/122/171/…) |
| +6  | u16 x    | 0xffff or 0 (placeholder/qualifier) |
| +8  | u16 flag | 0xffff or 0 |
| +10 | u16 year | season year 2023–2036 in GT (accepted filter 1990–2038) |
| +12 | u16 minutes | squad-wide distribution 0–3081; when a fringe player keeps not playing this is CONSTANT across years for the same series (62 spanning 2028–2036) |
| +14 | u16 | second minutes-like value (~45/90 on tiny rows, ~1.2–1.4× minutes on regulars) — semantics unresolved |
| +23/+25 | u8 | twin-byte pattern (33,33); u8@+23 ≈ appearances (563 min/7 apps, 2289/33) |

Head-family census (whole file, every 7th row): (k2≠ffff, x=ffff, fl=ffff)
≈2.63M rows; (k2=ffff, x=ffff, fl=ffff) ≈2.58M; (k2≠ffff, x=0, fl=0) 264k;
(k1hi≠0, k2=ffff, x=0, fl=0) 194k — the k1hi family's u32 key1 values are
0xffffffff-null + big team uids. Rows for the same head key collide in
contiguous non-grid runs (hash-table-with-linear-probe write pattern);
file order is neither per-club, per-person, nor chronological. Rows keyed
(k1, k2, year) are not unique — many rows share the same (716, year).

**St. Albans block analysis (441 rows, u32 key1=716):** 2023 rows are
zero-placeholder rows (pw=0, payload 0, u32@+30=1) allocated at career start;
per-year row counts grow 2023:5 → 2036:47 like squad growth; per-year +12 sums
track minutes played. All 441 rows have k2=ffff (null comp) — the comp-keyed
asymmetry vs other clubs' k2≠ffff rows is UNEXPLAINED. Payload field census:
u16@+36 is actually a byte field at +37 (low byte always 0 here): values
0x00–0x11 correlate with minutes magnitude (big buckets 100/100/57 rows at
0x00/0x100/0x200 for small minutes; single-digit buckets for 2000+ min) — a
minutes-class/performance bucket, NOT a person key. u16@+38 likewise byte@+39
(0x08–0xde, 191 distinct, group sizes ≤6) — not a key either.

**Ruled out (do not redo):**
- Person refs from person_record_history's id space do NOT appear in the
  rows: u16/u32 0x8eea (YT ref 36586, here a *club* uid collision: Sport
  Clube Tarouca) → 0 hits in 716-row payloads; 0xb604 (Dumas) → 0 rows on
  grid under the year filter at all (both as u16@0 head and in payloads).
- Rows are NOT per-person contiguous blocks; no person field pinned in
  payload offsets 0–148 at u8/u16/u32 const-across-series granularity.
- pl_hist_dt is league-hierarchy history, not the player binding; used_player_data ('tad.', 44 MB, delta-coded per-person attribute blobs) contains u16 0x8eea 3× but is otherwise a candidate index, unresolved.
- Constant-field grouping by +12 across years: works only for a few series
  (62/59/61/127); +12 value groups mix different players (small minutes recur
  for many players), so those "series" are not proven single-player.

**Working hypothesis for the binding (next steps):**
1. The row is per (team, comp, year, player-slot) where player-slot is an
   index into an external table — test whether row *file order* near the
   section head (first N thousand rows) correlates with used_player_data
   blob order, or whether a parallel (grid-pitch ≠ 152) structure in another
   section carries (club, person) pairs.
2. sim_stats.bin (151 KB 'tad.') — tiny; survey its record grammar for a
   person→slot map before assuming the slot theory has no source.
3. Diff test: pick two 716 rows with identical (k1, k2, year) and compare
   payloads byte-by-byte at u8 granularity for a differing small field —
   twin-byte (u8@23:u8@25) suggests byte-granular fields the u16-scan missed.
4. If the slot theory fails, decode rows at the *squad aggregate* level
   (minutes distribution per club-year) and mark player binding unconfirmed —
   the mission list (league positions/honours/cups/awards/transfers) does not
   strictly require per-player stats; player pages can come later.

Status: **SUPERSEDED by checkpoint 2 below** (binding solved; the offsets in this
section are framed from 0x139/9 — one byte off the true rows at offset 8). Priority check before more binding work: item 5
(news) and tc_best_eleven may unlock career features faster.

### player_stats_hist_dt checkpoint 2: binding SOLVED, INTEGRATED (2026-10-10; scans `tmp_pstats/q1–q38`)

**Integrated** as `Save.player_season_history(player_uids)` → `Table[PlayerHistoryStats]`
(`readers/player_stats_history.py`, `models/player_stats_history.py`,
`docs/reference/player_stats_history.md`; `PersonBlockDecoder.block_start` added).

**What solved it (three facts):**
1. **Framing.** Rows start at offset **8** (not 9/0x139): 8-byte head
   `03 01 'tmc.' 06 00` + 5,766,139 x 152 B exactly, byte +0 always 00. The old
   "+12 minutes" is the rating total (+13), "+14" is minutes (+15).
2. **There is an `_ls` after all — unlisted.** No `player_stats_hist_ls` is in the
   directory, but the span region (`unlisted_after_non_pl_hist_ls`) holds a 24 MB frame
   `03 01 'tad.' 04 00 | u32 76,091 free | free offsets | u32 239,790 lists | lists
   (delta-encoded, league-history grammar) | u32 4,507 empty-list numbers | u32 152 u16 6`.
   Found by scanning unlisted frame heads for the `tad. 04 00` tag (q26/q27). Free +
   listed rows = every dt row once. `pl_hist_ls` uses the same per-person grammar (free
   list first, empty-list numbers last) for `pl_hist_dt`'s 40-B pre-career rows.
3. **List → player:** the u32 21 bytes before the person block start (first-name id) in
   each player's `game_db` object. 217,876 distinct in-range values over 223,569 records,
   5,693 = 0xffffffff, 0 collisions. Found by locating the list number (from 2037 rows
   matched to `player_season_stats()` lines) inside the player records (q31/q32).

**Row fields** pinned against `player_season_stats()` on 340 same-snapshot lines (q36):
every mapped field 99-100%; line words at line offset k >= 27 sit at row offset k + 13;
small counts reordered (+17 goals allowed, +18/+19 pens, +20 red, +21 yellow, +22 clean
sheets, +24 starts, +25 subs, +26 rated apps, +27 goals, +28 assists, +29 PoM). +31 kind
= slot order (0 friendly, 1 league, 2 cup, 3 continental, 4 international); k2 (+5) = the
team's league competition, same on all a team's rows in a season.

**Validation:** best-eleven slots of bound players: per-team sum of kinds 1-3 equals
(appearances = rated appearances, goals) for 198,217/228,335 (86.8%); misses ~10%/season,
concentrated in calendar-year leagues (best-eleven year = history year + 1, spot-checked).
St Albans 2036/37 exact incl. rating total: Tshongo 45/0/3119, Gumbs 34/16/2391, Robinho
41/12/2852, Young-Thomas 37/10/2591, Hodges 26/4/1794, Dumas 37/11/2501.
Timing: index 2.6 s + binding 5.8 s once; each call ~3 s (dt decompress); RSS ~3 GB with
`players()` (54 s) loaded.

**Ruled out on the way (do not redo):** player refs/uids anywhere in the rows (the
Tshongo "+141 hit" is `37 00 c9 ff 06 00` = u16 55, i16 -55 — coincidence); row indices or
byte offsets as plain u32 in `game_db` or any listed section (St Albans rows vs random
control: equal hit rates); count-prefixed offset lists in `game_db`; `match_stats_cfg`
(a compressed per-match archive, `pks_0` table of (id, offset, size)) and
`used_player_data` as key arrays; the hash-table / per-team-block theories (pool order is
allocation order: blocks per team-season written at season end, holes reused).

**Open:** (a) ~~retired players' lists~~ **SOLVED for full objects — see "Retired players'
stats lists"**; (b) ~~+7 u32~~
**SOLVED: departure fee, +30 spell code — see "Transfer fees FOUND"**; (c) 0.53% field-for-field repeated rows in
lists (29,965; 2,561 with minutes) — cause unknown; (d) the u32 after the list number in
the person object (e.g. 269,669) — maybe another per-person index (injury/person-record);
(e) 2037 rows lag the live season.

### Transfer fees FOUND: player_stats_hist_dt +7 = departure fee, INTEGRATED (2026-10-10; scratch `fm26-career/tmp_fees/g1–g10, h1–h3`)

**Integrated:** `PlayerHistoryStats.departure_fee` (row +7, i32, -1 → None) and
`PlayerHistoryStats.spell_code` (row +30); `ClubPlayerMove.fee`, filled by
`Save.club_player_moves(club_uid, fees=True)` through `readers/transfer_history.move_fee`.
Docs: `docs/reference/player_stats_history.md`, `docs/reference/transfer_man.md`.

**The field.** When a player leaves a team, every history row of his last season there
(all competition kinds) stores the money of the move that ended the spell. Earlier
seasons of the spell, the current spell, and spells ended by a release / contract expiry
to no club keep 0xffffffff. Byte +30 is the spell type: 0 permanent, 1 loan (on both the
loan club's and the lending club's rows of that season; every St Albans code-1 row has a
type-3 move of the player that season or the next), 4 trial (every code-4 row has a type-7
move). On permanent spells +7 is the transfer fee, 0 for a free move; on loan spells 0 or
small sums (loan fees? unverified); the two trial-spell values (Sidwell) repeat the
following transfer's fee; one loan row holds -10.

**Join rule (`move_fee`).** Move types 1/4/5 only: the player's rows with spell code 0 and
a departure fee, at the move's origin club (`club_uid == from_club_uid`; team id when the
club does not resolve; team None for a move from no club), in season `date.year - 1` or
`date.year`; exactly one distinct value → the fee, else None. (Season-year window: Dutch
2036/37 rows for a January 2037 Ajax sale are season 2036, Molde's calendar-year rows for
January 2037 are 2037.)

**Validation (`club_player_moves(716, fees=True)`):**
- Event log: all 35 fee entries `club_player_moves` resolves agree exactly — 13 paid (Sidwell
  19,000; O'Farrell 1,324,615 out; Finch 13,569,109 out; Schoop 3,132,169; González
  1,445,149; Olagunju 15,857,448 out; Young-Thomas 2,700,000 in, 32,347,260 out; Tshongo
  8,250,000; Dumas 22,937,564; Kitić 93,501; Bonatti 5,000,000; Pedro 9,851,914) and 22 free
  (0). Not coverable: Ruff 20,000, Burley 60,000, Richard Thomas 67,160 (retired, not in
  `players()`; Thomas has no grid move at all) and Zedníček 6,465,898 (deal dated 1/1/2038,
  not yet executed — his rows end at CEC 2037 with 11,932,177, a different, earlier move).
- Coverage: 83/83 resolved incoming type 1/4/5 moves get a fee (27 transfers paid, 18+38
  type 4/5 all 0); out: 18/18 type-1 sales, 8/8 free moves to a club (0), 38 releases to no
  club None. 44 of the 127 "bought" are retired players (4 t1, 36 t4, 4 t5).
- Sum: incoming £99,174,811 (83 moves); + Ruff and Burley = £99,254,811 vs profile
  £101,492,665 — gap £2,237,854, unverifiable (retired signings from Hemel Hempstead and
  Charlton, 2024, are the remaining type-1 moves without a fee). Outgoing £89,759,304.
- Game-wide sample (20,000 type 1/4/5 moves ≥ 2030): t1 1,824/1,903 get a fee, none 0; t4
  between clubs 10,730/10,938 read 0; all 7,124 releases None. The 79 t1 misses are mostly
  players whose last rows at the selling club are loan-spell rows (code 1), or rows outside
  the season window — left None rather than guessed.
- Timing: `club_player_moves(716, fees=True)` 12.2 s with grid/players cached (3.8 s
  repeat); 350 movers, 8,984 rows.

**Ruled out / not done:** loan fees (type-3 moves) — values exist on code-1 rows but no
ground truth; not joined. Retired players' moves (their history lists are unbound, open
item (a) of the previous checkpoint). The -10 value and code 26 (one row each) unread.

### Retired players' stats lists: BOUND for full objects, INTEGRATED (2026-10-11; scratch `fm26-career/tmp_retired_stats/r1–r7`)

**Integrated:** `HistoryPerson.stats_history_index`, `PersonBlockDecoder.last_block`,
`readers/player_stats_history.history_person_list_numbers`,
`Save.history_person_season_history(references, *, goalkeepers=())`.

**Rule:** a full person object outside `players()` stores its list number 21 bytes before
its **last** validated person block, exactly as a current player does (first-block
picking gave ~1,000 duplicate numbers; last-block fixed most). Bind when the number is a
non-empty list, unclaimed by a current player, stored by one person only.

**GT save:** 17,407 non-empty lists have no current-player owner (not 21.9k as estimated
earlier). 24,960 objects store a number; 16,637 bind (95.6%). Validation against best
elevens (league+cup+continental, same or next season, any team): 41,225/45,431 (90.7%)
match on (apps, goals) vs 86.8% for current players; shuffled bindings 0.6%. St Albans:
7/44 retired best-eleven players bind, 32/32 of their St Albans seasons agree. Timing:
binding 8.3 s after `history_people()` (20.6 s); RSS 2.6 GB.

**Ruled out (do not redo):** stubs carry no list number anywhere within ±400 B of their
header (offset sweep against the unbound-list set: distinct hits at every offset ≤ 1,040
except k=0/30, which are the stub's own/previous reference coinciding with list numbers).
The game frees a player's list when it cuts him to a stub, so **most retired players'
per-season stats are gone** (37/44 at St Albans); best elevens (apps, goals, rating per
club-season, top 18) are the only per-player stats left for them.

**Fees:** `club_player_moves(fees=True)` now also prices movers outside `players()` via
these lists: St Albans gains 8 fees (7 free moves = 0, Jack Thompson → Vancouver
£55,000, 2029); incoming total unchanged at £99,174,811 (House/Hemel and Gough/Charlton,
the £2.2M gap, are stubs). Cost: `history_people()` + binding, ~100 s total cold.

**Open:** the 770 unbound non-empty lists (duplicates and objects whose block start is not
found); whether free rows still hold readable stub players' lines (they name no owner, so
only content matching against best elevens could place them — not attempted).

### tc_best_eleven_history_dt/ls — cell grammar pinned, owner/club identity OPEN (2026-10-10; scans b1–b31, tmp_besteleven/)

Extract: `/home/karl/fm26-career/tmp_besteleven/tc_best_eleven_history_{dt,ls}.bin`
(dt 13,466,112 B, ls 116,746 B). Section magic is `03 01 'tmc.' 02 00` — the
**tmc. family (same magic+version as tc_manager_history_dt)**, not tad. — so it
belongs to the manager-history domain, not the `tc_*_history` tad family.
Scripts `tmp_besteleven/b1..b31*.py`.

**What is solid (verified numerically, all on the GT save):**

- **dt = a grid of 509-byte cells**, `k*509`, k = 0…26,455 (26,456 cells)
  plus a final 8-byte dangling head exactly at 26,456×509. The ls file's own
  tail stores `[u32 509][u16 02 00]` — the cell size confirmed by the ls
  itself. Cell 0 doubles as the section head: `03 01 'tmc.' 02 00` + a small
  table (`ff 33 01 00 1d 00 00 00 f2 07 00 00 02 01 00 00 …` — includes the
  ids 307/29/2034/258; undecoded).
- **Every cell**: `[u8 T @+0][u8 kind @+1][00 @+2][u32 id3 @+3][04 @+7][u16
  year @+8]` + **18 units × 27 B at +10+27j** + 13 B tail. T ∈
  {0,1,2,3,4,7,9,10,11,12,13,15,16,18,19,20,21,22,27,255} (byte 7 = 04 on all
  26,455 cells; the single exception is cell 0). year@+8 census on cells:
  2022–2037, 16 values. Tag bytes (02) at unit-relative +12/+17/+22 verified
  36,000/36,000.
  - id3 = u32@+3: 20,960 distinct over all cells, p10/p50/p90 =
    9.1k/26.0k/53.9k, max 36.6M. id2 (= u32@+2) is **always id3 << 8** (the
    +2 byte is the head's 00) — do not read the id at +2.
- **Unit grammar**: `[u32 pid][u16 apps][u16 b][u32 rating-sum][02 u32 f1][02
  u32 f2][02 u32 f3]`. `apps` 12–49 on XI cells; `rating-sum / apps` ≈
  avg rating × 10 (6.3–7.0 typical); `b` small 0–5. Unit j=0 is special:
  f1=1, f2=0, f3=1 on every cell (reads like a manager/captain row or GK row).
- **ls**: header `03 01 'tad.' 04 00 | u32 0 | u32 2,724` + 2,724 groups
  `[u32 n (1–16)][n × u32 cell offsets]` + terminator `u32 0` + tail
  `fd 01 00 00 02 00` (0x1fd = 509 — the cell size). Entries ≡ 0 (mod 509);
  26,456 entries total; only **12,298 distinct** offsets — cells are shared
  across groups; 14,158 cells are referenced by no group. Reference counts
  per shared cell: 2–15.
- **Group shape**: n 1–16; ≤8 distinct seasons per group (histogram
  7×1118, 8×494, 6×295, 1×241, 5×158…); NO group spans 2023–2037 dense, so
  no group is a 15-season club or the manager's 15-season career. Group
  entries are dt-offset-ascending; years inside a group can interleave
  (e.g. 2023,2023,2025,2023,2026,… in group 25 — adjacent duplicate entries
  exist: the same cell twice, once per XI kind).

**Cell semantics (REVISED, see checkpoint 2 below):** a cell is a best-18
table over 18 units, but the b29-basis claim "same-id3 cells share 14.85/18
unit pids" was an ls duplicate-entry artifact (pairs over entries, not unique
cells). Measured correctly: same-id3 adjacent-year cell pairs = 1,372, of which
only 9 share any unit pid — **id3 ≠ club**. Do not redo the club model.

**OPEN / ruled out (do not redo):**

- id3 is NOT `Club.uid`: club 716/717 appear **nowhere** as a head id (0 hits
  as u32@+3 on any cell), while Club.uid space has 33,001 clubs. id3 is NOT
  player uid (0 of 20,960 in fmsave player uids), NOT team_id (only 3,239 of
  10,879 ls-referenced id3 values hit team_id — above random but partial),
  NOT the person_uid space.
- id3 spans ≤7 distinct seasons, mostly ONE (16,834 of 20,960 id3 values
  appear in exactly 1 season, 3,356 in 2, only 770 in ≥3) — so id3 is
  season-scoped, not a persistent club: **id3 identity unresolved** (a
  season-scoped club/team handle in the tmc. registry).
- **ls group owner unresolved.** Groups are 1–16 cells over ≤8 seasons, cells
  shared across groups (up to 15 groups per cell), and the candidate "owner
  pid appears in its group's cells" test FAILS: only 224 groups (exactly the
  n=1 singletons) have any unit pid common to all their cells. So a group is
  NOT a player listing the XIs he was picked in (his own pid would have to be
  in all of them), NOT a club (ids/units change within it), NOT a manager.
  Groups look like per-entity season lists pointing at (id3, season) cells
  owned by *someone else* — e.g. a player's per-season pointer to the XI page
  of the club he played at (owner need not be among the 18).
- unit pids: 123,638 distinct, all < 0xdfe41 (913,729), median 155,736 — a
  **third id space** (not Club.uid, not player uids, not person_uid, not
  team_id; 468 hits against non_pl_hist_dt ids ≈ below random). pid ↔ name
  mapping unresolved (used_player_data is the next candidate: 44.4 MB, tad.
  v0x23, per-person blobs).

**Remaining plan for this section:**

1. Pin id3: find the entity whose cells chain over years by squad overlap
   (union-find over ≥10/18 pid overlap, cells within ±2 seasons — b31 draft
   crashed before printing merges; rerun). A 2023→2037 chain = St Albans
   (career club). Then reconcile id3 against tc_manager_history_dt (same
   tmc. magic — its spell rows carry `<u32 club>` in Club.uid space — a
   cross-section id bridge may exist there) and against the 94 real id3↔staff
   uid hits found (managers: Paulo Fonseca = 1333).
2. Decode the 13-B cell tail + the small table in cell 0 (ids 307/29/2034/258).
3. Pin `b` (0–5: goals? clean sheets?) and f1/f2/f3 (position-class? awards?)
   via cross-cell consistency of the same pid.
4. Resolve unit pid→player: chain pids through shared cells into squads, then
   align squad-tenure patterns against fmsave players' club_membership years
   (join/leave) — no name registry needed for a first decode; names last.
5. Integration per the checklist, then the owner-requested **blind career
   report** (decoded data only, no screenshot/GT facts).

### tc_best_eleven checkpoint 2 (2026-10-10; scans b32–b54): the WALL, dt geometry, and the working model

Scripts `tmp_besteleven/b32..b54*.py`. All numbers on the GT save.

**The WALL (central measurement — kills every within-group entity model):**
within one ls group, cell unit-pid sets are mutually exclusive at every season
distance: dy=0 → 12,697 pairs, mean overlap 0.001; dy=1 → 37,426 pairs, mean
0.013; dy=2–6 → 0.004–0.007 — below the random-pair rate. Only ~30 heavy
within-group pairs exist (overlap 10–17, all dy=1). NOT a family artifact:
same-(T,kind) within-group pairs Jaccard 0.0011 (1,250 pairs), and 26k heavy
cross-group pairs are cross-family, so unit pids are one global space. The ~30
anomalies: consecutive-year cells in a group sharing 6–17 of 18, different
(T,kind)/id3, one shared group — reads like the same squad recurring (e.g.
repeated honours).

**pid = player id in creation-order space (STABLE, verified):** 123,638
distinct unit pids, all < 913,729; per-year median rises 98,189 (2023) →
486,274 (2036) = allocation order. Aging-curve career chains prove identity:
pid 62872 appears 2023–2036, ~2 cells/season, apps ~4–13 (k=19 cells) vs
44–51 (k=18 cells) with mid-career rating peak — reading as cup vs league
appearances of one long-career player. ~2 cells/season ≈ one club's league +
cup + continental competitions.

**Squad continuity lives ACROSS groups:** all 1.37M shared-pid cell pairs
classified: 334,720 adjacent-year cross-group pairs (up to 17/18 shared);
within-group ≈ nothing. Union-find over ≥6-shared pairs: 52,561 heavy pairs;
top component = **42 cells, exactly 3 per season, every season 2023–2037**,
chained dy=1 (same (T,kind) family recurring year-to-year). Heavy pairs never
share id3 (0 of 52,561); their group-index delta is flat (groups are not a
club-ordered adjacency).

**dt geometry (new):** the grid is **season-major, and within a season slice
cells are ordered by ls-group index** — each group's entries sit at a stable
position inside each season's ~1.9–2.1k-cell slice; group gi's first-tier
cell = grid slot gi for the first ~42 groups. So dt is effectively sorted by
(season, group, tier).

**ls entries are pure offsets:** every entry ≡ 0 (mod 509) (b54 checked the
high bytes — no payload bits; the e>>16 histogram was just k/128). 26,456
entries, 12,298 distinct, mean refcount 2.15 (2–15).

**Groups are not cell-collection entities:** every cell of the 42-cell club
chain is claimed by a *different* single group (438, 450, 490, …), and group
438's 14 entries are mostly cells of unrelated chains. So a group does not
"own" an entity's cells — it references cells tied to it.

**Working model (fits every measurement; NOT yet proven):**
- cell = a **best-18 table for one competition-season** (id3 = competition-
  season id in the tmc. registry: 20,960 distinct id3s, 94% single-season ✓;
  different competitions same club-season ⇒ disjoint top-18s ⇒ THE WALL ✓;
  units = top-18 players of that competition that season, apps 12–49 =
  games in that competition ✓). id3=club, unit-squad models: dead.
- ls group = **a bounded spell window** (tmc. = manager-history family!):
  2,724 groups, ≤16 entries over ≤8 consecutive seasons, 2–3 cells/season
  (league+cup+continental), present every season of its span, each season's
  cells in different (T,kind) families. A spell *ends* — that is why no group
  spans 2023–2037 while clubs do (club 716 plays all 15 seasons, so
  group=club is dead on span evidence alone; also career_manager_spells()
  has only 271 open-spell rows, not these 2,724 windows).
- The ~30 heavy within-group dy=1 pairs = the same team recurring in one
  group across consecutive seasons (title defence / same spell, two seasons).
- kind-1 cells (493, k=1 unit): id3 = **person uid** — 7 decode to real
  historical figures via career_persons: Lothar Matthäus (1270), Nenad Vanić
  (1082), Juan Antonio Pizzi (1112), Didier Santini (1255), Nenad Bjelica
  (1407), Cato André Hansen (1651) — in (T,kind) ∈ {10/16/19/13}×1 families.
  First id3→name bridge in this section.

**Next probes (in order):**
1. Match groups against `tc_manager_history_dt` (same tmc. family): its spell
   rows have club + season spans in Club.uid space — find the group whose
   seasons/competition-pattern matches the manager's club-716 spells; a
   group↔spell bridge would pin group semantics and give id3 a season window.
2. Check whether all groups' entries for one season are in distinct (T,kind)
   families (club plays each competition once) vs repeats.
3. Pin unit pid→player via `used_player_data` (44.4 MB, per-person blobs) —
   then the whole section names itself.
4. Then integration per the checklist and the blind career report.


### Player identity SOLVED: unit pid = history reference = pindex + 1 (checkpoint 3, 2026-10-10; scans d4_*)

- A person's `game_db` object closes with `[u32 ref][u32 unique_id][u32
  unique_id]` (unique_id = uid + 1). For players `ref = pindex + 1`, the
  same id `player_scan.closing_unique_id` searches for (99.2% agreement with
  a full header scan: 206,125 / 207,801). Integrated as
  `Save.history_player_references()` (ref → player uid) and
  `Save.history_person_reference(uid)` (any person, header search).
- **Best-eleven unit pid = that reference, exactly**: cell id3 75245 (2036,
  T0 kind18) holds Dumas 189608, Young-Thomas 280836, Tshongo 458697, Gumbs
  493490 and Hodges 537474 at ref+0; ±1 hits scatter over unrelated cells.
  Named, it is St Albans' 2036 best-18 (17/18 resolve; apps 14–45, ratings
  6.5–7.2). The old "pid→player dead" entry tested `uid`, not the reference.
- Coverage of all unit pids by current players: 2037 88%, 2036 85%, falling
  to ~6–15% for 2023–2026 (players retired out of `players()`); 52,412 of
  123,639 pids named. Retired players need another name source (hall-of-fame
  persons, or their surviving non-player objects) — next probe.
- The same reference space appears in `transfer_man`, `person_record_history_dt`
  and `manager_manager` (5/5 test players hit 2–11×; random values in the same
  range: median 0 hits). person_record_history's refC (checkpoint 9: Dumas
  0xb604) is a different, second id space — the reference also occurs in that
  section, so its records carry both.

**Next:** integrate best-eleven cells (model + reader + `Save.` method,
units carrying `player_uid` via the reference map), then retired-player names.

### tc_best_eleven checkpoint 4: INTEGRATED — record framing corrected, ls = one list per club (2026-10-10; scans tmp_besteleven/i1–i8)

**Integrated** as `Save.career_best_eleven()` → `Table[BestElevenEntry]`
(one row per filled slot; `decode_best_eleven` in `readers/career_history.py`;
`docs/reference/best_eleven.md`). GT save: 474,491 rows, 26,456 records, 2,724
lists, every record threaded; pure decode 3.8 s, 19.5 s with the
player-reference join (player scan). Named share by season: 2036 96%, 2033
73%, 2029 41%, 2023 10%.

**Two corrections to checkpoints 1–2 (both made the old analysis wrong):**

1. **Framing:** the section is an 8-byte head (`03 01 'tmc.' 02 00`) + 509-B
   records `[u16 season][18 units][13 B tail][u8 T][u8 kind][00][u32 id3][04]`
   — the T/kind/id3 head **closes** its record. The old "cell at k*509, head
   first" framing paired every head with the *previous* table's units (that is
   why cell 0 had no head and an 8-byte head dangled at the end). Evidence:
   (T,kind)→mean-apps eta² 0.425 (old) vs 0.52 (new), per-(T,kind) apps SD
   tighter on nearly every family (e.g. (13,8) 3.4→2.2, (1,9) 4.2→1.7), and
   the 1:1 head↔units count. St Albans 2036's units sit under head
   (0,18,98390), not (0,18,75245).
2. **ls = the league-history list grammar** (delta-encoded, `offset[m] = v[m]
   + v[m-1]` past the 8-byte head; trailer `0, 509, 2`). Decoded that way
   every one of the 26,456 records is in exactly one list — the "12,298
   distinct / shared cells / THE WALL" results were artefacts of reading the
   raw values as offsets. Lists are clubs: St Albans = list 685, one record
   per season 2023–2036. **THE WALL, id3=competition-season and ls=spell-window
   models are all dead** (built on both artefacts).

**Semantics pinned on St Albans (all unconfirmed in the model):**
- season = starting year: list 685 runs 2023–2036 vs league-history ending
  years 2024–2037; paired so, (T,kind) changes exactly where the league
  competition does: comp 708→(2,4), 150→(0,7), 10→(0,8), 9→(0,10),
  8→(0,13), 7→(0,18). (T,kind) reads as a league id; id3 changes every season.
- slots 0–10 = XI (GK first), 11–17 subs; f3 = the slot's position bit (1 GK,
  4/16/8 defence, 128/1024/8192 midfield, 16384 ST), f1 = natural-positions
  mask, f2 = secondary mask (mostly 0); `b` = goals (0 on GK, ~8–9 mean on
  slot 10, ST); empty slot = ref 0xffffffff + zeros (1,717 slots, 11–17 only).

**Open:** ls list number → club uid (not stored; a league-title pin like
`club_league_history` may port: lists are probably club-uid ordered); the
13-B tail (ascending byte runs, 904 distinct); (T,kind) → competition id map;
retired-player names (pre-2030 rows mostly unnamed).

### History people checkpoint: retired-player names INTEGRATED (2026-10-10; scans tmp_retired/s1–s15, t_api)

**Integrated** as `Save.history_people()` → `Table[HistoryPerson]`
(`readers/history_people.py`, `docs/reference/history_people.md`), joined into
`career_best_eleven()` as `player_name` on rows with no `player_uid`.

**Proven on the GT save:**
- Retired players' objects survive in `game_db`, closed by `[ref][uq][uq]`
  (uq = uid + 1) like any person. Header references are strictly monotone in
  offset (players and non-players alike, 100%), so non-player headers sit
  between two players' headers with ref and uq inside both brackets. A full
  every-offset doubled-word scan (numpy, research only) bracketed 64,233 of the
  64,883 unresolved best-eleven pids, each exactly once; **650 have no
  bracketed header**.
- Name forms before the header: 18-B stub `10 00 [first id][surname id][4 flag
  B][u32]` (most retired players), 14-B stub `10 01 [common id][4 flag B][u32]`
  (mononyms: Renato Augusto, Wu Lei), or a full object read with the **last**
  validated person block (first-match picked another person's block in ~1/3 of
  cases; last-block = `players().name` on 2,000/2,000 sampled players).
- `career_persons().person_uid` **is** the person's unique id (= closing
  header uq) — the join the hall of fame lacked. 131/131 unresolved-best-eleven
  people with a HoF record agree by name (research scan); via the API, 4,539/4,539
  named HoF-joined people agree (49 more are unnamed objects).
- Coverage via the API: 63,684 / 64,886 unresolved best-eleven refs named
  (98.1%; 2023 98.2%, 2024 98.8%, 2036 99.0%). Research scan: 458 bracketed
  refs fit no form. Reader: 632,378 people in 8.7 s pure Python (gap-bounded
  `bytes.find` per reference; no every-offset scan) after the ~16 s player scan.
- St Albans 2024/25 (list 685, season 2024) names itself: Brad House (GK, 51
  apps), James Sweet, David Longe-King, Josh Leslie-Smith, Josh Debayo, Giorgio
  Rasulo, Laurence Wootton, Josh Castiglione, Shiloh Remy (20 g), Louis Dunne,
  Charley Kendall … Pharrell Williams (21 g) — all retired.

**Dead ends:** `career_persons()` as a name source (0.2% of unresolved refs);
`staff()` (0.9%, retired players turned staff — the stub/object forms cover
them anyway). Not needed/not tried: `used_player_data`, `person_db_changes`,
the install's `people_db.dat` (possible fallback for the ~1,100 left, since
many uqs look like original database ids, e.g. 29191769, 2000120283).

**Open:** stub flag bytes and trailing word; the 650 headerless + 458
formless refs; birth dates for stub people (not stored in the stub).

### news — DEAD END for career history: a 12-day rolling buffer (2026-10-10; scratch `fm26-career/tmp_news/`)

Extract `tmp_news/news.bin` (40,667,113 B, `03 01 'tad.'` head). Scripts
`hdr.py`, `h1840.py`, `range.py`, `check2025.py`, `item_types.py`.

**Item header (solid).** `u16 packed-day | u16 year | u32 news_id |
u8 flags (0x18 = 19,911 items, 0x38 = 346) | 40 00 | u16 type | ff…`.
Date = the usual fmsave game date (`_scan.decode_date`, slot in the high 7
bits). 20,257 items; `news_id` 6,090,468–6,110,798, **strictly increasing**
in file order (19,910/19,910 steps); first header at 0x2d7127 (the first
~3 MB is a different block: `13 c0`/`13 e0`-flagged records carrying
reversed 8-char `…pser` tags and 14,405 `tacn`/`tcsn` tag pairs, also Nov
2037 ids). 1,124 distinct types (top: 82 ×2057, 85 ×988, 86 ×979, 112
×912, 105 ×858, 111 ×836). Item bodies are parameter payloads, not text:
persons by **history reference** (Karl 328408 ×151, Dumas 189608 ×156;
staff/player uids ×0), teams by team id (603 ×1214), clubs by uid (716
×236, Shanghai Port 23292170 ×22) — partly inside tagged property maps of
reversed 4-char keys `tag | 01 | typecode (01 u32, 11 u8, 12 u16, 03 bool)
| value` (e.g. `SoFo` = club uid). Competition/stadium names and per-item
`u32 len | first | u32 len | last` person name tables are the only strings;
"St Albans" ×9, "Worthing"/"Young-Thomas"/"Shanghai Port" ×0.

**Why it is a dead end.** Every item is dated **23 Nov 2037 – 4 Dec 2037**
(save date 4/12/2037): FM keeps only ~12 days of news. A scan for the
header shape with any year 2023–2040 finds no older items (6 stray hits, all
non-items); `humans`, `media_man`, `manager_manager`, `interaction_manager`,
`press_conference_manager`, `save_game_summary` hold no news-item headers
either (scan `other_sections.py`). Hence:
- the 6 May 2025 season summary is **not in the save** (date 126/2025 ×0
  anywhere in the section; ±1 day ×2 each, coincidental);
- Dumas (10/8/2036) and Young-Thomas (9/8/2037) transfer news is gone; the
  20/87 hits on those dates are embedded unrelated date fields (no
  Dumas/YT/club refs within ±64 B); fee values as u32 23,000,000/32,500,000
  ×0, £k 23,000 ×7 / 32,500 ×11 (unrelated contexts).
- Only 219 items touch 716/603 bytes and 11 carry Karl's ref — all Nov/Dec
  2037, i.e. post-career (manager unemployed).

**Do not redo:** fee/season-summary hunting in news. A generic `NewsItem`
decoder would only ever expose the last ~12 days of the save's world news —
not career history — so it was not integrated. If live-news access is ever
wanted, start from the header above and the type distribution.

### Club Unique IDs SOLVED, swapped club headers INTEGRATED; club colours OPEN (2026-10-16; scratch in the fmcareer session scratchpad)

- **Swapped headers.** About 5.7% of club records (1,657 of 29,132 on a 2025/26 Turkish
  career) hold the missing-value marker at +13 and the league nation at +17, the reverse of
  the usual layout; +21 (FA nation) and +25 (nation copy) are as usual. The scan only tried
  the anchor at +17, so those clubs (e.g. Mezitlispor, Izmitspor) were missing entirely.
- **Unique ID = the next record's *stored* uid** (no +1). Confirmed on the ten clubs of the
  Turkish 2. League Red Group against two graphics packs' config.xml, and 853 of the game's
  861 licensed club badges (`club_<id>` in catalog_info.bin) match it, against 441 for the
  uid. The old rule (next *accepted* record's uid) was off by one everywhere and off by a
  whole club after every swapped record.
- Ruled out: the people-style rule (closing header's first word = own index + 1). Club
  indexes are not consecutive across records, so it resolved only 1,259 clubs.
- **League-table vote.** By the end of August every club has played friendlies, so the
  friendlies tied the league on member coverage and won on the lower id. The vote now
  counts first only competitions where a member meets another member of the same table.
- **Points are i16** (a -42 deduction read as 65494).
- **Club colours SOLVED, INTEGRATED** as `Save.club_colours()` (`readers/club_colours.py`,
  layout `CLUB_COLOURS`). Not in the club record: a second block per club in `game_db`, far
  past the club records (from ~52 MB on a 160 MB game_db), in club index order.
  - Kits are 27 bytes: `01 01`, five u16 **RGB555** colours, a pattern byte, a u32 stored
    twice (-1 on a new save, a small id such as 11 on some kits of a 14-season one), `00 00`,
    kit set, part (1-5, 0x11, 0x21 seen), two more bytes. A list is `[u8 count]` + kits.
  - **The club's two colours follow the list**: `FF R G B FF R G B` (Liverpool `CF1C2C`
    `FAFAFA`, Aston Villa claret and sky blue, Bradford claret and amber).
  - **Link**: the block opens with the club index, then `[u8][u8][u8][u8 n][00]`, n u32s,
    a flag byte and 10 (flag 1) or 6 (flag 0) bytes from it, then three `[u16][u16 year]`.
    A list's club is the nearest such head before it among the next 20 indexes after the
    last club placed, then the next 200 (a 14-season save has runs of 34 kitless clubs).
    Clubs without kits have heads too (Atherstone United between Aston Villa and Barnet),
    which is why the nearest wins rather than the lowest.
  - Ruled out: requiring all three dates non-null (true heads with a null third date exist:
    it dropped the Turkish save from 0.98 to 0.95); scanning every offset for any index (38 s,
    and false heads ~203/222 bytes before most lists win on nearness).
  - Placed 0.98 of kit lists (Turkish 2025/26) and 0.96 (14-season English); same-name
    men's/women's clubs agree on colour family 0.78, mostly shade differences. Fethiyespor
    is stored navy and white, which its home kit (white, navy stripes) bears out.
  - Not yet in `validate_save`: the fixture career stores no kit blocks.

### Remaining plan (owner priority, 2026-10-09: DECODERS FIRST)

**Superseded: the working roadmap now lives in `docs/PLAN.md` — every session
starts there.** Standing direction from the owner: the priority is **finishing the missing
decoders in fmsave** — no tooling/site work until the data is complete, since a
site built on partial data is built on guesses. The screenshots remain
calibration-only (each decoder's output gets validated against them; that
validation is part of the decoder work, not a separate step).

**Gaps between what the site needs and what fmsave currently reads** (decoders
for league positions, honours, cup runs, awards, manager spells exist):

1. **transfer_man (53 MB)** — transfer records are absent from fmsave (only
   transfer *windows* exist). The site's next-widest gap after league history:
   fees, dates, player/club ids (127 bought / £101M / £23M Dumas /
   £32.5M Young-Thomas pinned by ground truth). **START HERE.**
   Status: **73B season-grid reader INTEGRATED (2026-10-09) —
   `Save.transfer_man_player_seasons()`**: model `PlayerSeasonRecord` +
   reader `src/fmsave/readers/transfer_history.py`; reference in
   `docs/reference/transfer_man.md`. GT: 1,428,558 rows / 16 seasons
   (2022:39 … 2037:85,610), Dumas (716,7) 23,972@2036 and companion (716,172)
   32,604@2036 reproduce exactly; 98 ff-year junk rows excluded by the
   year-acceptance filter; ~13.4 s decode, cached. All 16 fields unconfirmed.
   Transfer *fees*: **FOUND (2026-10-10)** in `player_stats_hist_dt` +7
   (see "Transfer fees FOUND") — `Save.club_player_moves(club_uid,
   fees=True)` fills `ClubPlayerMove.fee`; the "Fee hunt CLOSED" checkpoint
   is superseded. **Wage ledger: INTEGRATED (checkpoint 7, 2026-10-10) —
   `Save.transfer_man_wage_ledger()`**, 32,235 GT records. **Checkpoint 8
   (2026-10-10): the grid rows are per-person career MOVES keyed by the history
   reference (not club/slot), with team ids and a game date —
   `Save.club_player_moves(club_uid)` names them; 127 bought reproduces
   exactly.** Remaining in
   transfer_man: zone1 negotiation (`0b`) records and family-A (the `03`
   family's "person" id space needs re-checking before integration — maps in
   checkpoints 1/3).
2. ~~Validation backlog~~ **DONE (checkpoint 4)**: anchors verified, reader bugs
   fixed, pytest pinned. The club-threading question is solved by the ls
   decode (checkpoint 5): St Albans = list 351, all seasons attributed.
3. ~~player_stats_hist_dt (876 MB)~~ **INTEGRATED (2026-10-10)** —
   `Save.player_season_history(uids)`; binding via the unlisted pool index +
   the list number before each person block (checkpoint 2). Open: retired
   players' lists (the +7 u32 is the departure fee, see "Transfer fees FOUND").
4. **tc_best_eleven_history_dt (13 MB)** — best XI per season.
5. ~~news (40 MB)~~ **DEAD END (2026-10-10)** — only a 12-day rolling
   buffer (23 Nov – 4 Dec 2037); no season summaries or transfer fees
   survive (see the news section above).
6. Lower priority: award_club_hist_dt (partly covered via award_year_hist
   club-award rows), tc_record_man (22 MB live-updating records, semantics
   unconfirmed — own project), tc_history_dt, tc_extended_club_records_history_dt.

## Squad registration rules (foreign / non-EU / home-grown) — INTEGRATED (2026-10-25; `Save.squad_rules()`, `Save.competition_squad_rules(db_id)`; scratch `fm26-career/tmp_rules/`)

Owner request: per-league squad-registration rules for a transfer-target tool (not history,
but it lives in `game_db`). Model `models/squad_rules.py`, reader `readers/squad_rules.py`,
layout `SQUAD_RULES`, check `squad_rule_lists_paired` (1.00 on both saves, floor 0.90),
tests `tests/test_squad_rules.py`. Upstream's `readers/rules.py` docstring records its failed
attempt (tagged groups found, no competition link); the route below is different and links.

- **Tagged-stream grammar, corrected.** `<4-byte tag reversed><01><type><value>`; the tag
  can be binary (`03 00 00 00`). Sizes: `0x00` none, `0x03` `0x11` `0x13` 1, `0x12` `0x14` 2,
  `0x01` `0x02` `0x15` `0x20` 4, `0x19` float32, `0x0F` (two u32, second = database id) and
  `0x18` 8, `0x1A` `u32 len` + UTF-8. `0x0A` = record of N *tagged* values; `0x0B` = array of
  N *untagged* elements (`<01><type><value>`). The compact id types `0x13`/`0x15` appear only
  in the older (14-season) database build. The layout's `TaggedStreamLayout.u32_types`
  (0x03, 0x0F as u32) is wrong for this region; the window reader never meets them.
- **Rule sets.** A nation's rules file holds `fxrl:0b` = array of set records (`name`,
  `hidl`/`lwdl` division range, 255 = open-ended, optional `comp` = competition named
  outright, `sqsr:0b` rules). `fxrl` also tags plain id values in competition files: only an
  array of records is a set list. Rule = `type` (code), `cmty` (1 min / 255 max — the game's
  paired "Minimum of N …"/"Maximum of N …" text), `valu`, `styr`/`enyr`, `info` flags,
  `cash`/`curr`.
- **Set → competitions.** The nation record holds `dvlv:0b` (element i = level i's
  competition, as a value or a record with `comp`/`DBID`; `nccc` = number of groups), the
  nation id right before it (`nati:12 <id>` or `nati{Nnat:12}`; a string in another id space
  in the old build → None), and `retm` right after it (the nation's competitions, a split
  level's groups following it). **Pairing = same unbroken tagged run**: walk forward from the
  set list to the first `dvlv`; failing that, the nearest earlier `dvlv` whose strict walk
  reaches the list (the reserve copy sits nested after it). Every levelled list pairs on both
  saves (76/76 fresh, 62/62 14-season); competition names check out (J1/J2/J3, Ligue 1,
  Premiership, Turkish Super League …).
- **Groups** (league split into regional groups; fmsave's league table uses the group, e.g.
  Fethiyespor = 463486 Red Group, not 463481 2. League) = the `nccc` entries after the level in
  `retm`. Heuristic, unconfirmed: right for 13 of 14 split levels by name, wrong for Wales.
  `competition_squad_rules` reports GROUP matches after COMPETITION/DIVISION, narrowest
  stored range first (2. League set before the amateur 2-and-down set).
- **Codes pinned by real-world rules** (calibration, not screenshot-confirmed; labels
  unconfirmed): 9 squad size (EPL/La Liga/Serie A 25, Türkiye 28); 18 max non-EU (La Liga 3,
  Ligue 1 4); 21 max foreign (Super League 14 [old DB: 11], 1. League 8, **2. League 0**);
  38 min club-trained (Bundesliga 4); 39 min locally trained (Bundesliga, Serie A 8); 146 min
  home-grown (EPL 8); 212 min nationals under contract (Bundesliga 12). ~168 codes in use;
  about 78% of rules (851 of 1,095 on the fresh save) are still UNKNOWN codes with raw numbers.
- **Ruled out** (do not redo): attributing sets by the nearest `file` name (the old build
  stores England/Spain/Türkiye/… rules with no file header — England's sets sit under
  `dan_rules`); by the nearest `Nnat` (wrong for Spain/Denmark); by competition refs inside
  the sets (only 42/170 lists carry any); labelling codes from `languages.fmf` (decompressed:
  204,707 zstd frames, 838 MB — stream 1 MB chunks, slicing per frame is quadratic; the
  max/min/label triples exist but are ordered by string id, and the code→string map is in
  native code); group → parent via fmsave stages/competitions (no link) or `retm` team-count
  sums (counts mostly absent).
- **Database content, moves with the build**: the two saves differ in 72 of 90 shared files.
- **Next:** pin more codes (in-game Rules → squad registration screens for TFF 2. Lig,
  Süper Lig, an EPL/Championship side — calibration only); nations reader for EU membership /
  work permits (who counts as non-EU/foreign: `lang_db` table `8_56` names "European Union",
  table `8_9` = nations, 765 England, 799 Türkiye, 763 Czechia, 764 Denmark, 796 Spain);
  not in `validate_save` (fixture career untested for it); no CLI yet.

## Names from the game install (2026-10-10; scratch `fm26-career/extract_names.py`)

fmsave ships no names and reads no game install by design; it takes a
`database_id,name` CSV via `fmsave.open(save, competition_names=...)`.
Building that CSV from the install (mounted at `/mnt/fm26`):
- `shared/data/database/db/<ver>/<ver>_fm/*.dat` = a **12-byte `03 01 'tad.'`
  wrapper + the same `fmf.` container a save uses** — strip 12 bytes and
  `fmsave._container.read_index` / `read_section` open it (server_db 77
  tables, lang_update_db 400 sections).
- Names live only in `lang_db.dat` (2600 base) / `lang_update_db.dat` (2620),
  sections `<language>_<table>`; **language 8 = English**. Table 25 =
  competitions keyed on the **editor database id** (= `Competition.database_id`:
  11 Premier League, 12 Sky Bet Championship, 13 League One, 14 League Two,
  109201 Enterprise National League, 5123055 Enterprise National League
  South); table 0 = awards. Record = `[u32 id]` + strings `[u32 len][utf-8]`
  each followed by a flag byte; table 25 ends a record with flag 00, table 0
  with one trailing 00. Other languages' headers differ (not needed).
- **`Award.award_id` = the award's position in the English award table**
  (ordered by database id): 99 → Sky Bet Championship Manager of the Season
  (107385), 101 → League One MoS, 103 → League Two MoS, 144 → Enterprise
  National League Manager of the Year (114799). Same in 2600 and 2620; a
  database update that inserts awards mid-table would shift it.
- Hall-of-fame honours resolve by database id directly (2024/25 English FA
  Trophy = 109202 ✓). Output CSVs are SI data: keep them outside the repo.

## Method notes
- Names live in `game_db`; history sections reference people/clubs by uid (u32 LE),
  often with the doubled/sound-header encoding fmsave uses for persons.
- Competition names are NOT in the save (fmsave docs are explicit): the game renders
  them from the installed database. fmsave `competitions()` gives
  `Competition(id, database_id, name=None, stage_ids)` — any name mapping must come
  from the editor DB keyed on `database_id`.
- Club ids: `Club(uid, unique_id)` with `unique_id = uid + 1` for every club — the
  uid is one less than the editor's unique id everywhere (St. Albans 716/717,
  Stafford Rangers 717/718). Sections differ in which space they use: the club's
  own history rows use uid 716.
- ~~Transfer fees in transfer_man are u32 ÷1000~~ **REFUTED (2026-10-09)**: the u32
  at family-A +21 is a global monotonic **record id** (0→45,156, file-order
  sorted, +1 runs of 27/170 records) — not a fee. Family-A copies of
  22,952/22,963/32,500 were red herrings (each value recurs at dozens of
  unrelated sites), but strong fee candidates DO exist in the 73B season rows:
  Dumas £23M = 23,972 (P2=P4), Young-Thomas £32.5M = 32,604 (P3=P4) — both
  slightly above the UI fee (add-ons? see transfer_man section).
- Dates: many sections store (u16 day, u16 year) where day counts within a season
  starting ~1 July (182 ≈ 1 July), 1900 (`6c 07`) = null sentinel. Some serialized
  records embed dates as `… <u8> <u8> <u16 year>` word runs (year u16 last).
- `fmsave.open(save)._read_section(name)` gives the decompressed bytes — good enough
  for analysis; extracted copies in analysis workdir are not committed.
- For FM24-imported careers: game_db carries duplicated player records (old + new copy);
  see `src/fmsave/readers/player_scan.py` dedup fork (keep the latest copy, warn).
- `scripts/decode_comp_history.py` walks comp_history_dt rows (stride 55 from offset 55)
  and prints rows matching a club uid.
- FM24-import artefact boundary: club season chains in comp_history_dt end at
  season 2021/22; pl_hist_dt carries the pre-career league chain 2004–2023 as a
  frozen, byte-identical blob across saves 10 matchdays apart (it is untouched post
  import). Anything from later seasons must come from other sections
  (tc_*_history / tc_record_man / tc_manager_history_dt).
- Manager uid in history sections = the game_db value + 1 (0x775648bf here); when a
  person's uid is 2002143422 in fmsave, search history sections for 2002143423.
